"Lots of people tweeting pictures from their cars of their snowy commutes to work, whilst saying 'stay safe' Oh, the #irony!"

- The speaker implies that there is a contradiction in the actions of people who are driving in potentially dangerous snowy conditions while also advising others to stay safe. This irony arises from the fact that they are engaging in an activity that may compromise safety (using a phone to tweet while driving) while simultaneously promoting safety.
  
- The speaker likely thinks that there is hypocrisy or a lack of self-awareness in these people's actions. They find it ironic or somewhat ridiculous that the same individuals advising others to be cautious are engaging in risky behavior themselves.
  
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are largely saying the same thing: the behavior they observe is contradictory or ironic.

Finally, the speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their statement expresses genuine sarcasm or criticism about the contrast between the act of tweeting while driving and the advice to "stay safe."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis identifies the irony in people tweeting pictures of snowy commutes while advising others to "stay safe." Here's a summary:

- **Implicature**: By calling out the irony, the speaker highlights the contradiction in urging safety while potentially engaging in unsafe behavior (tweeting while driving).
  
- **Presuppositions**: It is assumed that driving in snow is risky and using a phone while driving is unsafe.
  
- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to point out and criticize the perceived hypocrisy or lack of self-awareness of those tweeting from their cars, by highlighting the irony.
  
- **Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence is negative, as it critiques the contradiction in behavior.
  
- **Pretense**: There's no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they openly express criticism through sarcasm.
  
- **Meaning**: The literal act of tweeting "stay safe" contradicts the implied riskiness of the situation, emphasizing the irony and making the tone sarcastic.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker uses sarcasm to draw attention to the irony and criticize those who are tweeting about safety while potentially compromising it themselves. No major changes are needed in the preliminary analysis.

The statement is: "Incidentally the foreword for movie #BhopalAPrayerForRain is by Subroto Roy Sahara - saying - justice delayed is justice denied. #Irony"

- The speaker implies that having Subroto Roy Sahara contribute a foreword that discusses justice, particularly in terms of "justice delayed is justice denied," is ironic. This is likely because Subroto Roy Sahara has been involved in legal controversies himself.
- The speaker thinks that there is a notable contradiction between Sahara's statement about justice and his own past experiences or reputation regarding legal and justice-related matters.
- What the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are the same; they both point out the incongruity between Sahara's statement on justice and his personal history.
- The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; they are clearly pointing out the irony and possibly criticizing or disbelieving the appropriateness of Sahara's involvement with the film's foreword.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement discusses the foreword of a movie "Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain," written by Subroto Roy Sahara, who states "justice delayed is justice denied." The speaker finds it ironic due to Sahara's own legal controversies, suggesting a mismatch between Sahara's statement on justice and his past. The implied meaning is that Sahara's involvement in discussing justice is inappropriate or ironic given his history. 

The implicature is that having Sahara speak on justice is unfitting due to his legal background. The presupposition is that Sahara's past legal issues are widely known, making his statement ironic to the audience. The intent of the speaker is to point out this irony, possibly as a critique or mockery of Sahara's role in the film's foreword. The polarity of the last sentence is negative due to the use of the word "irony" suggesting disbelief or criticism. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are straightforward in highlighting the contradiction.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker uses irony to emphasize the contradiction between Sahara's statement and his reputation, achieving a tone of skepticism and mockery.

The speaker's emotions are mixed, as suggested by the emojis, fluctuating between suspicion and amusement. The analysis interprets the emojis as a sign of genuine feelings, indicating no pretense in the speaker's attitude.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

The speaker implies skepticism towards a media claim about the game's release date, indicating that the information is incorrect. The tone is straightforward and corrective, aiming to dispel the false claim. The speaker's implication aligns with their belief that the announcement is inaccurate, and there is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they seem genuinely intent on correcting misinformation rather than employing sarcasm.

"Just ranted on and the moment I'm about to hit send, my ipod just died. #greatmorning #NOT"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are frustrated and annoyed because of an unfortunate and ill-timed technical issue. The use of sarcasm in "#greatmorning #NOT" further implies that the situation has negatively affected their morning.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that the situation is inconvenient and perhaps even comical in its timing, as it prevented them from sending their rant. They express disappointment and irritation at the turn of events.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts convey a sense of frustration and displeasure with the situation. The sarcastic tone reinforces the sentiment that the situation is unwanted and bothersome.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
It doesn't seem like the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude; rather, they are expressing genuine frustration through sarcasm. The exaggerated tone of "#greatmorning #NOT" suggests a candid admission of their annoyance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker is expressing frustration due to an unfortunate technical glitch: their iPod died just as they were about to send a rant. The use of hashtags "#greatmorning #NOT" implies sarcasm, as it conveys the opposite of what the speaker literally means. The phrase indicates that the speaker has had a distinctly negative experience, contradicting the literal meaning of "great morning." The speaker's intent is to share their irritation humorously, with an expectation that their audience will understand and perhaps relate to this common inconvenience.

Upon reviewing the analysis, it's clear that the speaker is not pretending to feel differently than they do; the frustration is genuine. The use of sarcasm through the hashtag "#NOT" explicitly indicates a negative tone, contrasting with the superficially positive descriptor of the morning. Thus, the literal meaning of a "great morning" is flipped to imply precisely the opposite.

Considering these points, the statement is indeed sarcastic, as the speaker uses sarcasm to highlight their displeasure in an exaggerated manner.

"Re: prison book ban - Of course Grayling is also trying to ban Judicial Reviews #irony"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that Chris Grayling, presumably referred to as Grayling in the tweet, has an ironic stance. They suggest that while he is banning books in prison, he is also attempting to limit or eliminate Judicial Reviews. The use of "#irony" suggests that the speaker finds it contradictory or hypocritical that someone involved in making judicial or legal decisions is also trying to curtail a process that reviews such decisions.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems critical of Grayling's actions. By noting the irony, the speaker likely believes that banning Judicial Reviews is not consistent with someone who might be an advocate for justice or fairness. This critical tone suggests disapproval of Grayling's actions regarding both the prison book ban and Judicial Reviews.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are consistent. By pointing out the irony, they both imply and perceive this scenario as contradictory and worthy of critique.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending; their statement appears to reflect genuine criticism and disapproval of Grayling's actions. The tone and use of the hashtag "#irony" suggest a straightforward critical stance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement in the tweet critiques Chris Grayling's actions, highlighting an ironic contradiction. The speaker implies that while Grayling is involved in judicial and legal decisions, he is simultaneously attempting to limit Judicial Reviews, which could be seen as a mechanism for ensuring justice and fairness. The hashtag "#irony" underscores their perception of this contradiction as hypocritical. The speaker's intent is to criticize Grayling, showing disapproval of both the prison book ban and attempts to limit Judicial Reviews. The tone is negative, and there is no pretense; the speaker's criticism appears genuine.

The statement is sarcastic. Although the literal meaning suggests an expected course of action, the use of "of course" and "#irony" indicates that the speaker finds Grayling's actions contradictory and hypocritical, using sarcasm to highlight their criticism.

The statement "Matters we may exert or influence a change. But friendships aren't progressed this way. Some natural affinity is needed," highlights the distinction between what can be controlled through effort and what requires a natural connection. The speaker implies that unlike other aspects of life where influence and effort can lead to change, true friendships rely on inherent compatibility or chemistry, suggesting that they cannot be artificially constructed.

- **Implicature:** Effort can change some things but not friendships, which need a natural connection.
- **Presuppositions:** Natural affinity is essential for developing genuine friendships.
- **Intent of the Speaker:** To emphasize that genuine friendships can't be forced; they depend on natural connections.
- **Polarity:** The tone is neutral to slightly positive, suggesting a realistic view on relationships.
- **Pretense:** There is no pretense; the speaker's view is earnest and straightforward.
- **Meaning:** The literal meaning aligns with the implied meaning; friendships need more than just effort—they need an authentic bond.

Statement: "final labs coursework submitted!! now to treat myself by catching up with the whole semester's lectures #winning #not"

1. **What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?**
   The speaker implies that they have just completed and submitted an important piece of coursework, but they still have a significant backlog of lectures to catch up on. The use of "#winning" sarcastically suggests that they do not feel particularly successful despite having completed the coursework.

2. **What does the speaker think about the situation?**
   The speaker likely feels a sense of relief or accomplishment from submitting their coursework, but this is overshadowed by the daunting task of catching up on lectures. The hashtag "#not" clarifies that they don't genuinely feel like they are "winning."

3. **Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?**
   Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think convey that while one task is completed, there is still much to do, and the situation isn't as positive as the initial celebratory tone might suggest.

Finally, it doesn't seem like the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their use of sarcasm shows a candid, if humorous, acknowledgment of the ongoing challenges they face.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement reflects sarcasm, as evident through the discrepancies between the literal and implied meanings. The speaker uses a celebratory tone initially by stating they have submitted their coursework, accompanied by "#winning," a phrase typically suggesting success. However, the implied meaning through adding "#not" contradicts this positive tone, indicating they do not feel genuinely accomplished due to the need to catch up on an entire semester's worth of lectures. 

The implicature suggests the speaker faces more challenges despite completing one, and they implicitly express frustration with their situation. The presupposition is that the coursework submission is supposed to bring relief or a sense of victory, but in reality, it does not. The intent is to humorously highlight the ongoing struggle of academic responsibilities and contradict the expected joy of submitting coursework. This contrast between anticipated satisfaction and actual workload is where the sarcasm lies, and the speaker is candidly pointing out this discrepancy without pretense.

In summary, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker sarcastically uses "#winning" to contrast their genuine feelings about the situation, where they feel far from victorious due to the accumulated lectures they must address.

The tweet states, "@Mr_laddu and if Marathi man speak hindi to Chu*** samajhte hai #irony"

- The speaker implies that there is an irony in how people perceive a Marathi man speaking Hindi. It suggests that when a Marathi person speaks Hindi, they may be underestimated or looked down upon with a derogatory mindset (as inferred from the use of the censored word "Chu***").
- The speaker likely thinks that this situation is unfair or unjust, possibly criticizing a stereotype or bias against Marathi speakers when they communicate in Hindi.
- What the speaker implies (irony and derogatory perception) and what the speaker thinks (unjustness of the situation) align with each other, as both focus on the negative and unfair treatment of Marathi speakers using Hindi.

Overall, the speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude; rather, they genuinely express disdain or critique towards this perceived societal bias.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The tweet from @Mr_laddu discusses the perceived irony in how a Marathi man speaking Hindi is often derogatorily underestimated. The tweet implies that when a Marathi individual speaks Hindi, they are subjected to a negative stereotype or treated with disdain, as evidenced by the partially censored derogatory term. The presupposition is that society unfairly judges Marathi speakers negatively when they communicate in Hindi. The speaker's intent is to highlight and possibly critique this societal bias and express disapproval of such discrimination. 

The polarity of the tweet is negative, reflecting discontent with how Marathi speakers are perceived. There's no pretense; the speaker does not try to mask their genuine attitude toward the situation. The difference between the literal and implied meaning is that while the literal interpretation mentions a basic language exchange, the implied message is about the unfair treatment and stereotype against Marathi speakers.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, no substantial changes are needed as it captures the key elements accurately. Given all these considerations, the tweet is indeed sarcastic. The use of "#irony" and the exaggeration of bias signify the speaker's sarcastic approach in pointing out the societal issue.

The speaker says, "Brother💙 we don't look alike #not #frère #family #lovehim."

- The speaker implies a sense of closeness and affection towards someone they consider a brother, despite acknowledging that they do not physically resemble each other.
- The speaker likely thinks positively about their relationship. The use of words like "frère" (brother in French), "family," and "lovehim" suggests warmth and closeness, while the hashtag #not indicates a playful denial about looking alike.
- Yes, what the speaker implies through their affectionate language aligns with what they think about the situation; they have a strong familial bond that transcends physical resemblance.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement is not sarcastic. Here's why:

1. **The Implicature**: Although the speaker acknowledges that they and their "brother" do not look alike, the use of affectionate language and emojis suggests a close bond and affection. The statement goes beyond the literal "we don't look alike" to imply a strong relationship that is not based on physical appearance.

2. **The Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that a brother can mean someone beyond just a biological sibling. The affection indicated by "Brother💙," "frère," "family," and "lovehim" shows that the speaker values the emotional connection.

3. **The Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker hopes to express love and belonging, emphasizing that their bond is not affected by their appearance. The speaker uses the platform to celebrate the relationship.

4. **The Polarity**: The tone is positive, as indicated by the affectionate language and emojis.

5. **Pretense**: There seems to be no pretense in the speaker's statement; they genuinely express love and connection.

The speaker implies that there is a perception or stereotype that Charles Barkley, who is perhaps not typically recognized for having insightful discussions on race, has surprised people by engaging in an intelligent conversation about it. The use of sarcasm suggests that there might be an expectation that he would not be capable of such a discourse. 

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to think that the assumption or stereotype is flawed or unfair and that Barkley is capable of having an intelligent discussion on race issues. The use of sarcasm indicates that the speaker may actually support Barkley's ability to discuss these topics intelligently.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, in this case, they are aligned. The speaker uses sarcasm to imply that it is unexpected or unusual for Charles Barkley to have an intelligent conversation about race, but it is clear that the speaker's actual belief is that it is indeed possible and perhaps undervalued.

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation; rather, they are using sarcasm to highlight their genuine attitude, which seems to be supportive or defensive of Barkley's capabilities.

The speaker utilizes sarcasm to challenge the stereotype and to express support for Barkley's capabilities in such conversations. The emphasis on sarcasm reveals the speaker's intention to highlight an unfair assumption while affirming Barkley's intellectual contributions.

- **Presuppositions**: The speaker assumes an audience would share or recognize the stereotype about Barkley.
- **Intent**: The speaker aims to defend Barkley and counter an existing stereotype using sarcasm as a rhetorical tool.
- **Polarity**: The tweet has a negative tone when read literally, but the sarcasm shifts the polarity to a positive implication of Barkley's abilities.
- **Pretense**: There's no real pretense; the speaker's sarcasm directly reflects their supportive stance.
- **Meaning**: Literally, it’s dismissive and doubtful, but the sarcasm implies the opposite—a defense of Barkley’s intelligence with respect to discussing race.

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker suggests that as time goes by, humans are becoming less humane or more beast-like, indicating a negative transformation.

2. **Presuppositions**: It is assumed that the audience understands the concept of time leading to change and agrees that these changes are negative.

3. **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker aims to express a shared concern or discontent with the current state of affairs and the perceived negative evolution of human behavior.

The tweet states, "Picked an excellent day to get my hair done 😒 #sarcasm."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the day they chose to get their hair done turned out to be a bad choice. The use of sarcasm suggests that something negative or undesirable is happening or has happened that makes getting their hair done on this particular day not ideal.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that the circumstances surrounding their hair appointment are unfortunate or frustrating in some way. They seem to be dissatisfied with the timing or other factors affecting their experience today.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts align in suggesting dissatisfaction or disappointment with the timing of their hair appointment.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is not genuinely expressing joy about the timing of their appointment; instead, they are using sarcasm to express their displeasure, which suggests they are using irony to convey their true attitude.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis indicates that the tweet, "Picked an excellent day to get my hair done 😒 #sarcasm," is sarcastic. The implicature reveals that the speaker implies their hair appointment day turned out to be a poor choice, and the presupposition is that something unfavorable happened to make it a bad choice. The speaker intends to express dissatisfaction or frustration with the situation, using sarcasm to highlight that the day was not actually "excellent."

The polarity of the tweet is negative, given the displeased tone indicated by the use of sarcasm and the emoji. There is pretense in the speaker's attitude as they do not genuinely believe the day was excellent—they are expressing the opposite through sarcasm.

Literal vs. Implied Meaning: The literal meaning suggests a positive choice of day, but the implied meaning, reinforced by the sarcastic hashtag and emoji, conveys that the choice was, in fact, far from excellent.

The preliminary analysis accurately identifies the sarcasm in the statement, with all elements aligning to indicate the speaker's true, negative sentiment. No changes are needed; the statement is indeed sarcastic.

The tweet states: "Haha guess my tweet was ok then. Are you back in training @charliejnwalker"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they were uncertain or seeking validation about the quality of their previous tweet, and perhaps after receiving some feedback or lack of criticism, they conclude it was satisfactory. They also imply that they are inquiring about @charliejnwalker's training status, suggesting that this person is involved in sports or a physical regimen of some kind.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to think that their tweet went over well enough or at least without negative repercussions, which suggests they have a somewhat lighthearted or relieved attitude about it. They are also curious or interested in the activity or status of @charliejnwalker regarding whether they are in training, pointing to a friendly or familiar relationship.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think appear to be aligned. They convey a sense of relief or contentment concerning their tweet's reception and at the same time express interest in the activities of @charliejnwalker.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude. Their casual tone and use of humor (evident in the "haha") suggest a genuine and relaxed demeanor throughout the conversation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**The Implicature:**
The speaker implies that they initially had some uncertainty about how their previous tweet was perceived, but now they feel it was received as acceptable or satisfactory. They also imply a casual, almost familiar inquiry into whether @charliejnwalker has resumed their training, indicating some level of friendship or camaraderie.

**The Presuppositions:**
The speaker presupposes that @charliejnwalker will understand the context of both the tweet's reception and the training status. They also assume that @charliejnwalker is indeed involved in training, which could imply a shared interest or previous discussion about it.

**The Intent of the Speaker:**
The speaker's aim seems to be twofold: to express relief or satisfaction about the reception of their tweet, and to inquire casually about the training status of @charliejnwalker. By addressing @charliejnwalker directly, it suggests an interaction directed at a specific individual with whom they share context.

**The Polarity:**
The tone of the last sentence appears to be neutral to positive, driven by the casual and lighthearted inquiry phrased with "Haha."

**Pretense:**
There is no evident pretense in the speaker's attitude. Their use of humor and casual phrasing reflects a sincere, easygoing interaction.

**Meaning:**
The literal meaning of the statement asks for validation about a past tweet and inquires about someone's training status. Implied is the speaker's underlying relief that their tweet did not garner negative feedback and their ongoing interest in another person's activities.

**Analysis and Conclusion:**
The preliminary analysis appropriately identifies the tone and intent; however, there’s a need to emphasize the non-sarcastic nature of the statement more strongly. Given the context, tone, and lack of any contradictory cues, the statement does not appear sarcastic. The humor seems sincere, suggesting no hidden criticism or irony. The conclusion is that the statement is not sarcastic.

"@coreybking thanks for the spoiler!!!! #not"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they are not genuinely thankful for the spoiler provided by Corey B. King. By using "thanks" followed by "#not," they indicate irony or sarcasm. It suggests that the spoiler was not appreciated or that it was shared without consideration for the speaker's enjoyment or preference.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely thinks the situation is frustrating or disappointing. They probably believe that Corey B. King ruined an enjoyable experience by disclosing a spoiler, indicating a negative sentiment towards the act of spoiling.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication of sarcasm and the actual thinking align in expressing annoyance or dissatisfaction with receiving a spoiler.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is pretending to be thankful as a form of sarcasm. They are using irony to highlight their dissatisfaction or annoyance with the spoiler situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the statement "@coreybking thanks for the spoiler!!!! #not" is sarcastic. The speaker implies annoyance or frustration towards receiving a spoiler from Corey B. King, despite the literal "thanks." 

Implicature: The speaker implies dissatisfaction with the spoiler, contradicting the literal expression of gratitude. 
Presuppositions: The speaker presupposes that everyone understands the spoiler was unwelcome and that the hashtag "#not" negates the thanks.
Intent: The speaker aims to convey their displeasure over receiving the spoiler, likely hoping Corey or others will acknowledge this sentiment or avoid spoiling content in the future.
Polarity: The tone of the final part of the statement (#not) is negative, indicating dissatisfaction.
Pretense: The speaker's attitude is pretentious, adopting feigned gratitude to mock or express their anger ironically.
Meaning: The literal statement thanks someone for a spoiler, but the implied meaning, given the context and use of "#not," is a complaint against the spoiler.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it is accurate and sufficiently explains the sarcastic nature of the statement. The analysis could emphasize the stark contrast between the use of "thanks" and the dismissive "#not" to reinforce the sarcasm further. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

- The speaker seems to have a strong reaction or feeling about the situation, which motivates them to post something online, suggesting either enthusiasm, disappointment, or any other strong sentiment.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker is implying a strong emotional reaction to something related to the conversation, likely a topic about the Braves baseball team. The statement suggests an urge to share content relevant to the unfolding events or discussion with @TheBravesAddict, a fellow enthusiast. 

The presupposition is that both parties involved have a shared interest or understanding of the context that gives the post significance—probably related to a recent game or event involving the Braves.

The speaker’s intent seems to be about further engaging or expanding on the subject by posting a potentially humorous, insightful, or critical piece of content via the provided link.

Statement to analyze: "My coach is so supportive. 'tighten your belt, pick up the weight and just do it.' #sarcasm #ithinkhehatesmesomedays #itsmostlylove"

- The speaker implies that their coach's approach to support is more about pushing them with tough love than being gently encouraging. The use of the word "supportive" in quotation marks and the hashtag #sarcasm suggest that there is a hint of irony about how "supportive" the coach really is.
- The speaker seems to have mixed feelings about the situation. While they acknowledge the coach's tough approach, they also mention "it's mostly love," indicating that they understand the coach's intentions come from a place of wanting them to succeed, even though it might feel harsh at times.
- The implication and the speaker's thoughts do not completely align. While they suggest sarcasm in the coach's supportive nature, indicating the coach might seem unsupportive or tough at times, the speaker also recognizes that there is underlying care.
- The speaker is partially pretending to have a certain attitude. They use sarcasm to express frustration or humor in the situation, but ultimately reveal their understanding and appreciation for the coach's intentions.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "My coach is so supportive. 'tighten your belt, pick up the weight and just do it.'" along with the hashtags #sarcasm and #ithinkhehatesmesomedays indicates a sarcastic tone. The speaker uses sarcasm to highlight the irony in labeling the coach's tough, no-nonsense directive as "supportive." 

Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies that the coach's style of support is more about being demanding than providing gentle encouragement, using "supportive" ironically.

- **Presuppositions**: It's presupposed that the coach's tough approach is intended to drive the speaker towards success, even though it can seem harsh.

- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to communicate humorous frustration and acceptance regarding the coach's style. They are venting but also acknowledging the underlying care and encouragement.

- **Polarity**: The tone is mixed. While there is a negative undertone in the sarcasm about feeling pushed hard, the follow-up indicates positive acknowledgement of the coach's intentions.

- **Pretense**: Yes, there's pretense in presenting the coach's harsh phrasing as "supportive," with sarcasm revealing the speaker's humorous take on the situation.

- **Literal vs. Implied Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests the coach is supportive; the implied meaning, through sarcasm, conveys that the support is non-traditional, involving tough motivation.

Given this analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker's use of sarcasm humorously critiques the coach's tough motivational style while also recognizing its intent to be beneficial. The preliminary analysis effectively captures the statement's ironic nature and doesn't require changes.

The speaker's tweet says, "People complain about my backround pic and all I feel is like 'hey don't blame me, Albert E might have spoken those words' #sarcasm #life."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is implying that their background picture is drawing criticism or negative reactions from others. However, they are being somewhat defensive and dismissive of the criticism by suggesting that the content of the picture (likely a quote or statement) could have been attributed to a respected figure like "Albert E," presumably Albert Einstein, suggesting that the content may hold significant meaning or wisdom.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to think that the criticism of their background picture is unwarranted or perhaps missing the point. They appear to be using sarcasm to highlight their belief that the message or content of the picture is valid, even if it has been met with disapproval.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned in that they both suggest the criticism is unjustified or viewed with a hint of sarcasm, leveraging authority by mentioning a figure like Albert Einstein as a defense or dismissal of the complaints.

The speaker is likely pretending to have a casual or indifferent attitude toward the complaints through the use of sarcasm, as indicated by the hashtag #sarcasm. This suggests a level of detachment or lack of seriousness about the criticism they are receiving.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's tweet is a sarcastic response to the criticism they have received about their background picture. By suggesting that "Albert E," likely Albert Einstein, might have spoken the same words as depicted in the picture, the speaker implies that the content should be respected or valued. The speaker uses sarcasm to dismiss the criticism as unwarranted or missing the point.

**Implicature:** The implication is that the criticism is trivial because the content of the picture could be associated with a respected intellectual figure like Albert Einstein.

**Presuppositions:** It is presupposed that the speaker's background picture contains words or content that have drawn criticism.

**Intent of the speaker:** The speaker hopes to nullify or belittle the complaints while simultaneously suggesting the content has inherent value.

**Polarity:** The tone of the statement is dismissive, carrying a negative slant towards the criticism.

**Pretense:** There is a pretense of nonchalance or detachment, as indicated by the use of sarcasm.

**Meaning:** The literal meaning points to people complaining about the picture, but the implied meaning is to highlight the undue criticism by tying the words to someone as credible as Einstein.

The preliminary analysis is accurate; the statement employs sarcasm as a rhetorical tool to belittle criticism by suggesting the background picture's content has validity due to a possible association with Albert Einstein. The statement is sarcastic.

Christmas alone😊 how nice #not

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that spending Christmas alone is not actually nice, despite the initial positive phrasing followed by the sarcastic hashtag "#not."

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is likely feeling negatively about spending Christmas alone. The use of sarcasm here suggests that they find the situation undesirable or disappointing.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the actual thought express dissatisfaction with the idea of spending Christmas alone. The sarcastic tone helps convey this.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is using sarcasm to pretend they are glad about spending Christmas alone when, in fact, they feel the opposite.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement "Christmas alone😊 how nice #not" implies discontent with spending Christmas by themselves. Although the sentence starts with a seemingly positive phrase, the use of "#not" explicitly signals sarcasm, indicating the speaker's genuine negative feelings about the situation.

**Implicature**: The implication is that the speaker does not actually find Christmas alone pleasant, contrasting with their initial positive phrase.

**Presuppositions**: The assumption here is that Christmas is typically a time spent with others, and therefore being alone on this holiday is viewed as undesirable.

**Intent of the speaker**: The speaker, likely an individual expressing their feelings, intends to express their dissatisfaction and disappointment about being alone on Christmas.

**Polarity**: The overall tone is negative, as evidenced by the sarcastic hashtag and the contradiction between the initial positive tone and the real sentiment.

**Pretense**: There is a clear pretense as the speaker initially pretends to be happy about the situation before revealing their true feelings with sarcasm.

**Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests a positive outlook ("how nice"), but the implied meaning refers to the speaker's actual negative feeling about spending Christmas alone through sarcasm.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, no changes are necessary, as the assessment accurately identifies the sarcasm and discontent in the statement. The statement is indeed sarcastic, as it pretends to convey pleasure while expressing dissatisfaction.

The statement is "#Celtics RT @ShannonMoorer: And then there were none http://t.co/UV8jQ7OEd1"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that something significant has happened concerning the Celtics, potentially indicating a loss or an elimination of players or opportunities, as suggested by the phrase "And then there were none."

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely feels a sense of finality or disappointment about the situation being referenced. The use of the phrase suggests a conclusion or an undesirable end.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies about the situation and what the speaker thinks seem to align, both pointing to a turn of events that leads to a zero or non-existent state.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
There is no clear indication that the speaker is pretending to have a specific attitude. The statement seems to straightforwardly express a sentiment of finality or conclusion concerning the referenced link.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
### Analysis

1. **Implicature**: The phrase "And then there were none" implies that something has come to an end or that everything/something significant is gone. In the context of the Celtics, it could mean that they have lost a game, all players have left, or they're out of a competition.

2. **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that the audience knows about the Celtics and the significance of their current situation. The presupposition is that something considerable has occurred concerning the Celtics that leaves them at zero.

3. **Intent**: The speaker, likely a fan or commentator, wants to highlight a significant event that has affected the Celtics, potentially eliciting emotional reactions from fellow fans or followers. The intent could be to provoke discussion or commiserate over a loss.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the statement is negative. The sentence "And then there were none" typically connotes an undesirable or final event.

5. **Pretense**: There doesn't appear to be any pretense in the speaker’s attitude. The statement seems direct and conveys a straightforward sentiment of finality without hidden motives.

6. **Meaning**: Literally, the statement "And then there were none" suggests a complete disappearance or end. The implied meaning in this context is the Celtics experiencing a significant loss or decline.

### Conclusion

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the phrase used is recognized as borrowed from a well-known literary title associated with finality or disaster, which adds a sarcastic flair due to its dramatic nature applied here to sports. However, without definitive evidence of satire or humor in the tone, the statement, while morose, isn't inherently sarcastic. The dramatic tone might hint at sarcasm, but given the context and lack of clear pretense, it doesn’t definitively fall into sarcasm. 

Overall, it is not a clear example of sarcasm. It is a straightforward expression of disappointment regarding the Celtics, potentially seasoned with a touch of dramatic flair due to the phraseology.

The speaker says, "I'll try to guess the ASCII symbols without my admins help. Always trying to learn."

- The speaker implies that they are taking on a challenge or task independently, without relying on their admin, and are open to making mistakes as part of their learning process.
- The speaker seems to be genuinely interested in self-improvement and gaining new knowledge by engaging in this activity on their own.
- What the speaker is implying (independence and a learning mindset) and what they think (a positive outlook on learning and self-effort) are consistent with each other.
- The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; they appear to be genuinely enthusiastic about the opportunity to learn and grow from the experience.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement, "I'll try to guess the ASCII symbols without my admin's help. Always trying to learn," implies that the speaker is taking responsibility for their learning process and is willing to attempt tasks independently to gain new skills or knowledge. The speaker presupposes that the reader understands the context of needing help from an admin, suggesting a prior reliance on them for such tasks. The intent appears to be a genuine expression of self-reliance and enthusiasm towards learning. The polarity of the statement reflects a positive tone with no sign of pretense, as the speaker honestly communicates their desire to learn.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, no elements need altering, as the speaker's intent is clear and aligns with a genuine, earnest approach. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

"That sad moment you realize you're past the point of having all those presents under the tree. I wanna move back in."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are no longer experiencing the excitement or joy associated with receiving many gifts during the holiday season, which is something they miss about their past.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to feel nostalgic and somewhat saddened by the fact that they are no longer in a situation (presumably childhood) where they received many presents. They express a desire to return to those times, which suggests they have fond memories of that period.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think converge on the idea of nostalgia for the past and a longing for the simpler joys associated with it, like receiving many presents during Christmas.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude. They genuinely express a sense of longing and wistfulness about past holiday experiences.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker expresses a longing for the past when they received many presents during the holiday season, implying nostalgia for simpler, joyous times, likely from childhood. The speaker's intent seems to reflect a genuine wistful desire to return to that period or recreate those experiences, indicated by their wish to "move back in," presumably to a time and place associated with receiving more presents. This sentiment is neither masked nor pretended; it reflects authentic nostalgia and a negative tone due to the reference to a "sad moment."

Reviewing the analysis, the statement carries a sense of missing childhood excitement associated with receiving gifts, and the wish to "move back in" may suggest a hint of humor about the unrealistic desire to revert to childhood. However, the intent appears genuine rather than sarcastic. The lack of pretense in expressing their feelings supports this genuine tone. Thus, the statement is not sarcastic but rather a candid expression of longing for the past.

The statement says: "#Irony http://t.co/yeIqA3NfS1 Reverend tells kids that Santa is not real why declaring a sky fairy is because a book says so. #LOL"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?  
  The speaker implies that there is irony in the reverend's actions or statements. Specifically, the speaker finds it contradictory that the reverend dismisses the belief in Santa by comparing it to believing in a "sky fairy" (presumably referring to God), and justifying this belief simply because it is written in a book (likely meaning the Bible).

- What does the speaker think about the situation?  
  The speaker likely thinks that the situation is hypocritical or humorous. The use of "#Irony" and "#LOL" suggests that the speaker finds it amusing or absurd that the reverend is dismissing one belief while simultaneously advocating for another based on similar premises.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?  
  Yes, what the speaker implies about the situation being ironic is in line with what they think; both indicate the speaker finds the circumstance contradictory and amusing.

Finally, the speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. The use of hashtags like "#Irony" and "#LOL" suggests that the speaker is genuinely expressing their perception of humor and irony in the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement is a critique on what the speaker perceives as irony in a reverend's actions. The reverend dismisses the belief in Santa while promoting belief in a "sky fairy" (likely a reference to God) based on scriptural backing, which the speaker finds contradicting. The speaker implies that preaching faith in religious figures while denying Santa's existence is a paradoxical stance. They find humor in this, as indicated by the hashtags "#Irony" and "#LOL," suggesting both amusement and criticism. 

The implicature reveals that the speaker sees contradiction in religious faith being upheld purely because it's documented in holy texts, while dismissiveness is applied to myth-based beliefs like Santa's. The presupposition here is that both beliefs are equally unfounded in tangible proof; hence, holding one belief over the other seems inconsistent to the speaker. The intent of the speaker is to highlight the contradiction, poking fun at how religious scripture is used to justify one belief while rejecting another fantastical one, aiming to draw a laugh from the audience.

The polarity of the statement is negative, as it is critical of the reverend's stance, and the use of "irony" and "LOL" further enhances this with a mocking undertone. There is no pretense; the speaker is overtly expressing what they truly think is humorous and contradictory about the scenario. 

The literal meaning is a factual recount of the reverend's actions, while the implied meaning suggests a commentary on the incongruity in religious versus fictional beliefs. Based on this analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic—it outwardly mocks the inconsistency without direct insult, employing humour and irony to undermine the reverend's logic.

No, the speaker does not seem to be pretending. The expressions used appear to be genuine and heartfelt, indicating real appreciation for their time with their daughters.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis indicates that the speaker is genuinely expressing joy and gratitude for spending time with their three daughters, affectionately referred to as "Belles," in Wicklow. The hashtags used, such as "#lucky" and "#havefun," reinforce the positive sentiment and indicate that the speaker truly feels lucky and is enjoying the moment. 

In this context:
- The implicature is that the speaker is experiencing a joyful and cherished family moment.
- The presupposition is that the speaker has three daughters and they are currently spending time together in Wicklow.
- The speaker's intent seems to be sharing a personal, happy moment with their social media audience, possibly to convey gratitude or celebrate their family.
- The polarity of the statement is positive, evident from the use of affectionate and joyful language.
- There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they seem to genuinely appreciate the time and are not pretending.

"Joe Cole just casually walking past..."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies a sense of casualness and perhaps surprise at seeing Joe Cole, who is presumably someone of note or fame, walking by without any grandiosity or attention-seeking behavior.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to find the situation noteworthy or remarkable in a subtle way, as if encountering someone famous or significant in an ordinary setting is an experience worth mentioning.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thought suggest an unexpectedness or casualness in seeing Joe Cole in a seemingly normal situation, hinting at contrast between his public persona and current low-key behavior.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending; the statement reflects a genuine combination of mild surprise and casual acknowledgement of the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature**: The speaker implies that Joe Cole is someone of interest, and encountering him in a nonchalant manner is unusual or unexpected.

**Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that Joe Cole is well-known and notable enough to warrant attention when seen in public. There is also a presupposition that usually, someone of his stature might attract more attention.

**Speaker's Intent**: The speaker aims to highlight the surprising nature of seeing Joe Cole in an everyday context without any fanfare. The speaker is addressing an audience who would understand Joe Cole's significance.

**Polarity**: The statement has a neutral to slightly positive tone, as it expresses mild surprise or curiosity without negativity.

**Pretense**: There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; the surprise and casual acknowledgment appear genuine.

**Meaning**: Literally, the statement describes Joe Cole walking by. Implied is the notable nature of this everyday action due to Joe Cole's fame, and the contrast between his public image and a mundane scene.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, there is an understanding of surprise at fame meeting the ordinary, but no indication of sarcasm. 

Given these observations, the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker genuinely acknowledges the situation with interest but without irony or pretense.

The speaker's statement is: "Everytime I try to like Chris Brown he does something to royally eff that up. Dude is a chronic loose cannon #chrisbrown #Karrueche"

- The speaker implies that Chris Brown has a pattern of behavior that repeatedly disappoints or frustrates them, preventing them from sustaining a positive opinion of him.
- The speaker seems to think that Chris Brown is unpredictable and often engages in behavior that negatively impacts his reputation or likeability.
- What the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are consistent. Both the implication and the speaker's thoughts convey a sense of exasperation at Chris Brown's actions and a perception of him as unreliable or troublesome.

The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude; their frustration and disappointment seem genuine based on the statement provided.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement by the speaker suggests that they are consistently disappointed by Chris Brown's actions, which hinder their ability to like him. The speaker implies that Chris Brown frequently engages in behavior that undermines any positive opinion others might have, labeling him a "chronic loose cannon," which underscores his unpredictability and tendency for negative actions. The presupposition here is that the speaker has attempted to like Chris Brown on multiple occasions but has been thwarted each time by his actions.

The intent of the speaker seems to be to express frustration and disillusionment with Chris Brown's behavior, possibly hoping to share their sentiment with others who are familiar with his controversial reputation. The speaker's use of the words "royally eff that up" carries a negative tone, reflecting this disappointment.

There is no indication of pretense; the speaker's attitude seems sincere in their disapproval. The literal meaning of the statement aligns with the implied meaning, which is frustration at Chris Brown's inability to maintain good behavior. 

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it seems accurate in capturing the speaker's genuine frustration, with no indication of sarcasm. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

"Lol everyday excuse the language #relationships #men #women #irony #lotd http://t.co/XaHt7aPD93"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is something humorous or ironic about a recurring situation involving relationships, men, or women. The use of the hashtag "irony" suggests there's a twist or contradiction in the behavior or statements related to this context.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker appears to find humor in the situation, as indicated by the use of "Lol." This suggests they don't take the occurrence too seriously and perhaps see amusement in the repeated patterns or behaviors linked with relationships.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, the speaker's implication of irony aligns with their humorous take on the situation. Both imply that the situation is not only routine but also amusing in its predictability or contradictions.

Finally, there is no strong indication that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude. The use of "Lol" suggests a genuine amusement rather than a sarcastic or feigned one.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis outlines several key aspects regarding the statement:

- **Implicature:** The speaker implies that there's irony or humor in a situation that is typical or routine involving men, women, and relationships. The use of irony suggests a twist or contradiction in this usual context.

- **Presupposition:** It's taken for granted that there is a daily occurrence tied to relationships that merits the use of humor or irony. The speaker assumes the audience will recognize this recurring situation's predictability.

- **Intent:** The speaker appears to want to share their amusement and perhaps to engage others who might relate to the irony of the situation. They could be aiming for relatability and connection with an audience who understands the humor in daily relationship dynamics.

- **Polarity:** The tone is light-hearted and positive. While the last sentence doesn't carry a traditionally positive or negative statement, the "Lol" and hashtag "irony" convey that the speaker is not frustrated, but rather entertained.

- **Pretense:** There doesn't seem to be any pretense. The laughter ("Lol") implies genuine amusement, indicating the speaker is not pretending to be amused; they actually are.

- **Meaning:** The literal meaning suggests that the speaker is apologizing for their language about daily occurrences in relationships. The implied meaning is that these occurrences are routine to the point of being ironically humorous.

After reflecting on the preliminary analysis, there isn't much to change. The statement isn't sarcastic. The speaker genuinely finds humor in the irony of recurring relationship dynamics, and there's no indication of a pretense or a negative undertone that would suggest sarcasm.

"Well now the festive season has begun, let's take a moment to reflect on how much more royalties Slade and Wizard will get #sarcasm"

- The speaker implies that as the festive season begins, there's an expectation that Slade and Wizard, known for their classic Christmas songs, will earn significant royalties due to their music being widely played during this time. The use of sarcasm suggests this isn't meant to be taken at face value or entirely seriously.

- The speaker seems to think that the situation is somewhat overdone or predictable, likely indicating a belief that the repeated tradition of playing these songs might be a little exaggerated or monotonous, implying an eye-roll attitude toward the predictable cycle of holiday music and resulting financial gain for the artists.

- What the speaker implies and what they actually think do align, both hinting at a sense of predictability and mild annoyance or bemusement regarding holiday traditions involving music. The sarcastic tone underscores a certain tiredness or routine aspect of the situation.

The speaker is likely adopting sarcasm as a device to express humor or critique rather than having a deep annoyance, so they might be pretending in the sense of amplifying their reaction with sarcasm to engage or entertain their audience.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement is sarcastic, as indicated by the explicit use of "#sarcasm." 

**The Implicature:** The speaker implies that it's a predictable outcome that Slade and Wizard will earn more royalties due to the festive season, emphasizing a sense of routine and perhaps tedium associated with the repeated cycle of holiday music.

**The Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that during the festive season, music by Slade and Wizard will be frequently played, leading to increased royalties for them.

**The Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker aims to highlight the monotony and predictability of holiday traditions, specifically regarding music, by using sarcasm. They likely intend to entertain or humor their audience with a mild critique of the situation.

**The Polarity:** The tone of the statement is negative, as it critiques the repetitive and predictable nature of holiday music and the resulting royalties for these artists.

**Pretense:** The speaker's use of sarcasm suggests a pretense in amplifying their reaction to engage their audience, even if they are not deeply annoyed by the situation.

**Meaning:** The literal meaning of the statement is a straightforward observation about the expected increase in royalties for Slade and Wizard. However, the implied meaning is a critique of the predictable and somewhat tired cycle of holiday music that leads to this outcome.
 
The preliminary analysis accurately identifies the use of sarcasm and the speaker's likely intent to entertain or engage their audience by highlighting a predictable aspect of the festive season. The sarcastic tone effectively conveys mild annoyance or bemusement with holiday traditions, confirming the statement's sarcastic nature.

  The speaker likely thinks that the lack of clarity in conveying sarcasm in the posts can lead to misinterpretation or unintended consequences. They appear to be concerned about this misunderstanding and are suggesting a solution in the form of a sarcasm marker.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, they align. The speaker implies a potential misunderstanding due to lack of clear sarcasm markers and thinks it's important to address this to prevent followers from misinterpreting the posts.

Finally, the speaker appears to genuinely be suggesting a sarcasm marker, likely with light-hearted concern, rather than pretending to have a different attitude toward the conversation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the statement is implying that @Enasni's posts could easily be misunderstood by their geeky/nerdy audience due to a lack of explicit sarcasm markers. It presupposes that this audience might not naturally detect sarcasm and could end up mimicking the behavior or content that's intended to be sarcastic. The intent of the speaker seems to be to suggest a practical solution—using sarcasm markers—to prevent potential misinterpretations. The tone of the last sentence appears to be light-hearted and concerned, rather than sarcastic itself, as it ends with a smiley face suggesting friendliness. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they openly express concern about the potential for misunderstanding. The literal meaning is straightforward, asking for a sarcasm marker, whereas the implied meaning is the speaker's belief that the clarification is necessary to avoid confusion.

Upon reflection, the preliminary analysis holds clearly with the evidence in the statement. The tone, intent, and lack of pretense suggest that the statement is not sarcastic, rather a genuine recommendation with a touch of humor.

The statement is: "@playstation @sony #not #working when are we able to download games we paid in good faith? #psn start working again?" 

- The speaker implies that they are frustrated or dissatisfied because they are unable to download games from the PlayStation Network (PSN) that they have already purchased. 
- The speaker likely thinks that the situation is unacceptable, especially since they paid for the games in "good faith." This also suggests they feel let down by PlayStation/Sony and may believe PSN services are not reliable at the moment.
- Yes, what the speaker implies (frustration and dissatisfaction with PlayStation/Sony) and what they explicitly state (unable to download purchased games) are aligned. Both suggest disappointment with the situation and a demand for resolution.

The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; their frustration appears to be genuine given the context and choice of words.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature:** The speaker implies frustration and dissatisfaction with PlayStation/Sony because they are unable to download games they have already paid for.

**Presuppositions:** The speaker takes it for granted that they should be able to download the games they purchased without issues, suggesting an expectation of reliability from PSN services, which is currently unmet.

**Intent of the speaker:** The speaker aims to express their dissatisfaction publicly, likely hoping for a resolution or response from PlayStation/Sony. They are also addressing the companies directly by tagging them in the tweet, which indicates they want their complaint to be noticed.

**Polarity:** The tone of the statement is negative, as it expresses frustration and a call for a service that is not working to be fixed.

**Pretense:** There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude. Their frustration appears to be authentic and directly relates to the situation.

**Meaning:** The literal meaning of the statement is a complaint about PSN not functioning properly and a request for when they might expect it to work again. Implied, however, is a broader dissatisfaction with the company's service reliability and the experience post-purchase.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, there are no significant changes required. The statement is not sarcastic; it reflects genuine frustration and a straightforward request for resolution. The absence of irony, humour, or exaggerated discrepancies between literal and intended meaning supports this conclusion.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely finds waking up early unpleasant and may prefer to sleep in or start their day later.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Preliminary Analysis Summary:**

The speaker expresses a strong dislike for waking up early by stating "I hate waking up in the mornings" and supports this with the hashtags "#basicbrianna" and "#not #an #early #bird." This implies a genuine struggle with or dislike for early mornings.

*Implicature*: The speaker is implying more than just a dislike; they might be expressing a common and relatable sentiment about not being a "morning person."

*Presuppositions*: The statement presupposes that the audience understands the struggle with waking up early and may share or be familiar with this sentiment.

*Intent*: The speaker aims to express their disdain for early mornings, possibly seeking solidarity or sympathy from others. The use of hashtags appears to connect to a broader audience familiar with the sentiment.

*Polarity*: The tone is negative due to the expressed dissatisfaction with mornings.

*Pretense*: There appears to be no pretense in the attitude. The sentiment seems genuine, reinforced by emoticons and relatable hashtags.

*Meaning*: The literal and implied meanings align; both convey a dislike for mornings.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement does not exhibit characteristics of sarcasm as it directly conveys the speaker's negative feelings toward waking up early. The hashtags and emoticon serve to emphasize and share these genuine feelings rather than mask them with sarcasm. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

The tweet states, "in hereford but can't leave bambino alone!"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they are currently in Hereford and they have a responsibility or obligation that prevents them from leaving their bambino (likely referring to their child, pet, or someone they care for) alone.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker possibly feels constrained by their responsibility to care for their bambino, which limits their ability to move freely or engage in other activities apart from being present in Hereford and looking after their bambino.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts align in expressing a sense of responsibility or obligation that limits their mobility or freedom.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
  There seems to be no indication that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude. They are likely expressing a straightforward concern or situation about their inability to leave their bambino alone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature**: The speaker is highlighting their current location in Hereford and implies a sense of responsibility or obligation towards someone they refer to as "bambino," which prevents them from leaving that individual alone.

**Presuppositions**: The speaker assumes the audience understands what "bambino" refers to, likely a child, pet, or someone dependent on their care.

**Intent**: The speaker likely aims to express a sense of constraint or commitment due to their caregiving responsibility. The speaker is looking to communicate their preoccupation or obligation to the audience, possibly conveying a sense of frustration or helplessness due to being unable to leave.

**Polarity**: The overall tone can be interpreted as somewhat negative, as it suggests a limitation or a restriction in their current circumstances.

**Pretense**: There is no apparent pretense. The statement seems genuine, expressing a real concern or situation rather than an exaggerated or insincere claim.

**Meaning**: Literally, the statement mentions the speaker's location in Hereford and their inability to leave the bambino alone. The implied meaning suggests that their presence in Hereford is dominated by the obligation to care for the bambino, signaling a limitation imposed by this responsibility.

Reflecting on this analysis, it appears the speaker's statement is not sarcastic. The literal and implied meanings align, and there is no evidence of pretense or an exaggerated attitude. The speaker is straightforwardly communicating their current situation and the constraints posed by their role as a caregiver. The preliminary analysis is consistent in its interpretation and conclusion that the speaker is not being sarcastic.

The statement is: "Only a true nightshift person would understand this #nightshift #hardcore #teamwork #not #always... http://t.co/MpsXN3DJqU"

- The speaker implies that there's something particular about working the nightshift that only those who have experienced it can truly comprehend. They might be referencing an aspect of the job or a feeling that comes with working nights that isn't apparent to outsiders.
- The speaker seems to have a complex view of the nightshift experience. By using the hashtags #hardcore and #teamwork and then juxtaposing them with #not and #always, they might suggest there's a mix of pride and frustration in the experience. It indicates that while nightshift might sometimes require intense teamwork or is a tough job, it doesn't always align with these ideals or expectations.
- What the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are closely related but not identical. While they suggest a unique understanding is required, they also show an awareness of the difficulties or nuances through their choice of hashtags.
- It doesn't seem like the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude. The use of hashtags and their careful contradiction indicates a genuine expression of the duality of the nightshift experience, acknowledging both its demanding and possibly disappointing aspects.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker implies that there's a unique aspect of the nightshift that only true nightshift workers can understand. They use different hashtags to express mixed emotions about the nightshift experience, suggesting it requires intense teamwork or is challenging, but also indicating some frustration or disappointment by using contradictory hashtags like #not and #always. The speaker seems to have a complex but genuine view of the nightshift, without pretense in their attitude.

- The implicature is that being a nightshift worker involves experiences that are difficult to appreciate unless you've personally done it.
- The presupposition is that nightshift work inherently involves unique challenges.
- The speaker's intent is to connect with fellow nightshift workers who can relate to the experience, perhaps venting frustrations or sharing camaraderie.
- The polarity of the last sentence is mixed due to the contradictory hashtags, but it leans slightly negative due both to the hashtag #not and the implication of struggle or frustration.
- There is no pretense in the speaker's tone, as they candidly express the dual nature of their experience.
- The literal meaning focuses on understanding among nightshift workers, while the implied meaning points to the challenges and mixed feelings.

Given these elements, the statement can be considered sarcastic because it uses contradictions (like #hardcore and #not) to suggest the experience is not as straightforward as it might seem, implying frustration or unanticipated challenges with a playful tone. The hashtags create a sense of irony about the idealization of nightshift work versus its reality.

"You decide to go on vacation without me sleep? Reaaaal nice. #considerate #not 😒💤"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they feel left out or neglected because someone they know decided to go on vacation while they were asleep. They are sarcastically suggesting that it was inconsiderate to make such a decision without involving or informing them.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks the situation is unfair and inconsiderate. The use of sarcasm and hashtags suggests that they are annoyed or upset about being excluded.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are aligned. Both indicate a feeling of being overlooked or excluded, and point to a perception of inconsideration from the party that went on vacation.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is likely not pretending about their attitude. The use of sarcasm and emojis seems genuine, as it's a typical way to express frustration or annoyance on social media.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Preliminary Analysis Summary:**

The implicature in the statement suggests that the speaker feels neglected or excluded, as someone made a decision to go on vacation without them knowing, perhaps while they were asleep. The presupposition is that the speaker expected to be informed or considered in the decision-making process about the vacation. The speaker intends to express dissatisfaction and annoyance, and they use sarcasm to highlight the inconsiderate behavior of the other party.

The polarity is negative, given the tone implied by "Reaaaal nice," the hashtags "#considerate #not," and the emoji "😒", all indicating discontent. There's an element of pretense, as the speaker pretends to praise the decision but actually uses sarcasm to criticize it. The literal meaning of the statement is not aligned with the implied meaning; while it seems like a compliment, it is actually a criticism.

**Reflection and Decision:**

The preliminary analysis correctly identifies the sarcasm in the statement. The speaker's use of hashtags and emoji enhances the sarcastic tone, indicating frustration at being left out. Therefore, the statement is sarcastic.

The tweet states: "A lot of factors at play but I think you do retain him at max. Hopefully the FT's hurt his market a bit, selfishly speaking."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there are various considerations involved in deciding whether to keep a certain player at a maximum contract. Additionally, the speaker suggests that the player's free throws (FT's) are not performing well, which might decrease his market value.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker believes that despite the various factors, the team should retain the player at a maximum contract. Yet, they are also hoping, from a selfish perspective, that the player's free throws negatively impact his market value, potentially making it easier or more affordable for the team to retain him.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's direct thoughts align in their belief that the team should keep the player. The speaker's hope that the player's market is affected by his free throw performance, while selfish, supports their desire to retain him.

The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; rather, they openly express their hope that the situation might turn in their favor as a supporter of retaining the player.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature:** The speaker suggests there are multiple considerations in play regarding whether to retain a player at a maximum contract. The implied context is that the decision is based on the player's overall value and current market but also specifically mentions the player's performance in free throws (FT's) as a factor.

**Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that the player is considered valuable enough to warrant a maximum contract, and that free throw performance may potentially impact his market value.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker aims to express the complexity of factors in contract decisions while revealing a personal, selfish wish that the market value of the player might decrease due to a specific performance issue, making retention easier.

**Polarity:** The tone at the end of the tweet is slightly negative, as it reflects a wish for the player's market value to be negatively impacted for the speaker's gain.

**Pretense:** There is no pretense in the speaker's expression; they openly admit to a selfish desire impacting their viewpoint.

**Meaning:** Literally, the statement is about retaining a player at maximum contract value but implies a hope that the player's market competition decreases due to performance issues.

Reflecting on the analysis, the literal and implied meanings are consistent. The statement is not sarcastic because the speaker is earnest about their selfish hope, without employing irony or contradiction between literal and implied meanings.

The speaker's statement is: "LOL lets see if he actually READS it|@Laura_Charlii @RBRNetwork1 @Graves9".

- The speaker implies a level of skepticism about whether "he" will actually read the material in question. The use of "LOL" suggests that they find the situation amusing or are dismissive about the likelihood of "him" reading it.
- The speaker seems to think that it is doubtful that "he" will read it, indicating a lack of confidence in "his" follow-through or commitment to the task.
- The speaker's implication and what they explicitly state align; both suggest doubt regarding "him" taking the action of reading.
- The use of "LOL" might imply a lighthearted attitude or an attempt to downplay any seriousness about the expectation that "he" will read it, which may not fully reflect the speaker's true feelings of skepticism. This suggests a potential pretense of a more relaxed attitude toward the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis of the statement "LOL lets see if he actually READS it" indicates sarcasm through several elements:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies doubt that "he" will read the material, despite the apparent suggestion to the contrary.

2. **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that "he" is supposed to read something and that there is an expectation or a doubt associated with this task.

3. **Speaker's Intent**: The intent seems to be to express skepticism or disbelief about "he" reading the material, potentially making a social comment to others tagged in the conversation (Laura_Charlii, RBRNetwork1, Graves9), indicating shared understanding or criticism.

4. **Polarity**: The statement has a negative tone due to the skepticism about "he" performing the action.

5. **Pretense**: The use of "LOL" acts as pretense, suggesting a lighthearted tone but actually highlighting disbelief.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests amusement at the situation, while the implied meaning is skepticism about whether "he" will read.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement is likely sarcastic. The skepticism, the use of "LOL" to soften the critique, and the shared understanding between the tagged users emphasize the sarcastic nature. The preliminary analysis accurately captures these aspects, and no changes are required. The statement is sarcastic.

The speaker says: "@GlenjiUTLR @JoshStevo95 To be fair, you didn't use the mandatory #sarcasm hashtag :P"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  - The speaker implies that there was sarcasm involved in one of the previous tweets by JoshStevo95 or GlenjiUTLR, and that it was not clearly marked as such.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  - The speaker seems to find the lack of sarcasm indication amusing or light-hearted, as indicated by the use of the emoticon ":P", which suggests they are joking or teasing.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  - Yes, they both suggest that the initial comment needed a sarcasm warning but are doing so in a playful or joking manner.

Finally, the speaker is likely pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation by teasingly suggesting the use of a "mandatory" sarcasm hashtag, indicating they do not actually think there should be such a rule but are using it to humorously point out the sarcasm.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis identifies that the statement involves a playful implication that previous tweets contained sarcasm that was not clearly marked. The speaker uses a joking tone, highlighted by the emoticon ":P", suggesting that they are teasingly pointing out the lack of a "#sarcasm" hashtag to indicate sarcastic content. There is no real expectation or belief in the necessity of such a hashtag, indicating a pretense in the speaker's attitude. 

- **Implicature**: The tweet implies sarcasm was present but not labeled as such in earlier tweets.
- **Presuppositions**: The presupposition is that there's a norm or expectation of signaling sarcasm with a hashtag, which is not actually standard.
- **Intent**: The speaker aims to humorously highlight the sarcasm, engaging with @GlenjiUTLR and @JoshStevo95 in a light-hearted manner.
- **Polarity**: The tone is positive and playful.
- **Pretense**: The suggestion of a "mandatory" hashtag is pretense for humor's sake.
- **Meaning**: The literal demand for a hashtag contrasts with the implied joke about understanding sarcasm.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic, as it ironically suggests that a #sarcasm hashtag should have been used, when in reality, such a guideline is not required, emphasizing the light-hearted teasing of missed sarcasm by the original tweeters.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that Lance Stephenson is dealing with a physical issue that prevents him from joining his team on their road trip. His inability to run fully suggests some sort of injury or lack of fitness.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there was a task or information that was intended to be sent or shared, but there was a delay in the process. As a result, they had already taken action by posting before it was received by the intended recipients.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?

- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker intends to convey a sense of frustration with the delay and to highlight their proactive response. The speaker may also wish to inform the other parties of this action to keep them updated.

- **Polarity**: The tone is slightly negative due to the emphasis on the delay.

- **Pretense**: There is no indication of pretense in the speaker's attitude. The statement is direct and straightforward.

- **Meaning**: The literal meaning is that the speaker sent something but noticed in hindsight that it was delayed, prompting them to post it themselves. The implied meaning suggests slight frustration but also an assertive step taken by the speaker.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it appears to be correct in assessing that there is no sarcasm. The speaker's statement lacks any hidden meanings or irony and seems genuine in describing the situation. The speaker directly addresses the situation without masking their intention or tone with sarcasm. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

The statement is: "@MTNza so apparently twitter is free... so why is my data being depleted using twitter? #not impressed"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a discrepancy between what they were told or believe (that Twitter is free) and their personal experience (that it is not free, as their data is being used). This suggests confusion or misinformation regarding the use of Twitter with their data provider, MTNza.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is clearly frustrated or displeased, as indicated by the hashtag #not impressed. They likely feel misled or dissatisfied with how their data is being managed while using Twitter, contrary to their expectations.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and thinks emphasize a sense of dissatisfaction and confusion about why their data is depleting when using Twitter, which was supposed to be free.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending; their frustration and displeasure seem genuine, as evidenced by the direct manner in which they address the issue and use of the hashtag to express their dissatisfaction.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Upon analyzing the statement and the preliminary analysis:

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies there's a contradiction between the notion that Twitter usage should be free and the reality of data being depleted, suggesting misinformation or a service issue with MTNza.
- **Presuppositions**: The speaker takes for granted that there was an expectation or promise that Twitter usage would not affect their data allowance.
- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to express frustration and likely to get a response or a resolution from MTNza. The speaker is the user of the service, addressing MTNza.

- **Polarity**: The statement has a negative tone, especially with the inclusion of "#not impressed."
- **Pretense**: There appears to be no pretense; the speaker's frustration and dissatisfaction are genuine.
- **Meaning**: The literal meaning questions why data is depleting despite Twitter being "free," while the implied meaning is a critique of the perceived failure or misinformation of MTNza's service.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the analysis captures the user's frustration accurately and doesn't suggest any significant change in understanding. The statement is not sarcastic; it is a direct expression of dissatisfaction and confusion. The frustration is real and not masked under irony or sarcasm.

"@ozchrisrock hold on a minute. Are you saying All blonde white women look the same?? #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that @ozchrisrock has made a generalization about all blonde white women, suggesting that they are indistinguishable from one another. The hashtag #sarcasm indicates the speaker's disbelief or ridicule towards the possible generalization being suggested.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that the statement or implication that "all blonde white women look the same" is absurd or incorrect. They're using sarcasm to criticize or highlight the ridiculousness of the generalization.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think align. The sarcasm indicates that they do not agree with or believe in the supposed generalization about blonde white women.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is pretending to agree with or seriously consider the statement through sarcasm, while in reality, they are mocking or highlighting its absurdity. The use of sarcasm indicates that the speaker does not genuinely hold the attitude they are presenting at face value.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's tweet implies that @ozchrisrock has made a broad and potentially discriminatory generalization about all blonde white women. The hashtag #sarcasm clearly signals that the speaker finds this idea ridiculous and is mocking it rather than agreeing with it. The speaker suggests disbelief and disapproval of such a generalization, illustrating their intent to criticize the notion through sarcasm. 

The statement's polarity is negative, as it conveys criticism and ridicule. The speaker's use of sarcasm indicates a pretense of agreement or consideration of the idea when, in reality, they are using this tone to point out its absurdity. The literal meaning, that all blonde white women look the same, is undermined by the sarcastic tone, which implies the opposite—that the generalization is incorrect.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, no major changes are necessary as the analysis correctly identifies the sarcasm and the pretense in the speaker's attitude. Clearly, the statement is sarcastic, as the speaker is not genuinely suggesting agreement with the idea but is instead highlighting its absurdity using irony.

The statement is: "I have this weird urge to buy a hamster."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?  
The speaker implies that they are experiencing an unusual or spontaneous desire to purchase a hamster, indicating that it may not be something they've considered seriously before.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?  
The speaker likely finds the urge to buy a hamster surprising or unexpected, and may not fully understand why they feel this way. They might be contemplating whether this impulse is a genuine desire or just a passing thought.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?  
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thought align in suggesting that this urge is unexpected. The use of the word "weird" suggests an element of surprise or puzzlement, which is consistent with the speaker's probable contemplation or uncertainty about this desire.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.  
There is no indication that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude. Their use of "weird urge" suggests a genuine expression of both intrigue and confusion regarding their sudden interest in buying a hamster.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In the statement "I have this weird urge to buy a hamster," the speaker implies that they are experiencing an unexpected or spontaneous desire to purchase a hamster, which they find surprising or puzzling. There are no presuppositions indicating prior motives or intentions toward buying a hamster, and the speaker simply shares their current feeling.

The intent of the speaker seems to be expressing their surprise or confusion at their own thought rather than conveying a genuine plan or action to purchase a hamster. The polarity of the statement is neutral; it doesn't carry a particularly positive or negative tone but rather a sense of curiosity. There does not appear to be any pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they genuinely express curiosity and confusion through their choice of phrasing. The literal and implied meanings align, with both pointing to an unexpected internal motivation that is somewhat irrational or surprising.

Thus, the statement does not seem to be sarcastic. The speaker is genuinely acknowledging a puzzling internal impulse without suggesting any underlying intent or mocking tone. The preliminary analysis correctly identifies that this is a straightforward expression of the speaker’s surprise rather than sarcasm.

"@ParasiteCoD maybe you should grind the gym man #not #calling #you #fat"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is implying that the person they are addressing, @ParasiteCoD, might need to spend more time at the gym, suggesting that they might be out of shape or overweight. The use of hashtags like #not #calling #you #fat implies a playful tone but still hints at the true intent behind the suggestion.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that @ParasiteCoD could benefit from going to the gym more, possibly for health-related reasons or physical fitness. It might also be intended as a humorous or teasing remark rather than a genuine concern for their fitness level.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the thought suggest that @ParasiteCoD should consider working out more at the gym. The playful denial in the hashtags does not change the underlying message that the speaker is making an observation about @ParasiteCoD's fitness or weight.

Finally, is the speaker pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation?
It seems the speaker is pretending to be light-hearted or humorous about the suggestion by using sarcasm or playful language through the hashtags. However, the underlying message still indicates a viewpoint that @ParasiteCoD might need to improve their fitness level.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**
The statement directed at @ParasiteCoD implies that this person could benefit from spending more time at the gym, suggesting they may be perceived as out of shape. The presupposition is that @ParasiteCoD might need physical improvements. The hashtags like #not #calling #you #fat imply a teasing or humorous tone, suggesting this is more a playful jab than an earnest suggestion. The speaker's intent appears to be to humorously tease or mock rather than seriously advise. The tone of the last sentence is seemingly negative, though masked with a playful pretense. The literal meaning suggests a serious note, yet the implied meaning, especially with the hashtag usage, indicates a sarcastic undertone.

**Analysis:**
The implicature suggests hypocrisy; while it pretends not to call @ParasiteCoD fat, it does precisely that under a guise of humor. There is evident pretense as the hashtags serve more to emphasize the intended sarcasm than to soften the blow. The polarity remains negative under the facade of humor, as it's critical of @ParasiteCoD's perceived physical state.

**Conclusion:**
Given the analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The literal statement is negated by the hashtags, which overtly imply what the speaker pretends to withhold, thus confirming a sarcastic tone.

The statement is: "I'm absolutely positive that Coaches love it when parents tell them how to coach and run their program. #sarcasm #NOT #sticktoparenting"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker is implying that coaches do not enjoy or appreciate when parents try to tell them how to coach or manage their programs.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker believes that parents should not interfere with coaching by attempting to tell coaches how to do their jobs. They likely view this interference as unwelcome and unhelpful.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, the speaker's implication that coaches don't love such interference aligns with their belief that parents should refrain from telling coaches how to coach.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker uses sarcasm to express their genuine disapproval of parents interfering with coaching. The hashtags reinforce this attitude, so the speaker is not pretending to have a different attitude; rather, they are using sarcasm to emphasize their true feelings.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement, "I'm absolutely positive that Coaches love it when parents tell them how to coach and run their program," is laden with sarcasm. The speaker implies that coaches do not actually appreciate parental interference, contrary to the literal words that suggest coaches love it. This is supported by the use of hashtags like #sarcasm and #sticktoparenting.

The implicature suggests an unwelcome situation for coaches, considering the presupposition that parents frequently offer unsolicited advice, which is often unappreciated. The speaker's intent is to criticize and dismiss the idea that parents should instruct coaches on how to run their programs.

The polarity of the statement is negative, as it conveys disapproval and dissatisfaction with the situation. The speaker does employ pretense, as they pretend to hold a positive attitude towards parental interference when in fact they are expressing the opposite sentiment through sarcasm. The literal meaning contrasts with the implied one; while the words suggest a positive reception of advice, the implication is that such advice is unwelcome.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it correctly identifies sarcasm as the primary rhetorical device used by the speaker to communicate their genuine disapproval. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"Getting Final Jeopardy correct on Kids Jeopardy boosts my self-esteem"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they find value or satisfaction in correctly answering a question on a version of Jeopardy meant for children. This hints that they might usually not find success with answering Jeopardy questions correctly or that it's out of their usual realm of knowledge.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that being correct in this context provides a humorous or ironic boost to their confidence, given that it involves a children's version of the game show. They might find it amusing that getting a question right in this simpler version gives them a sense of accomplishment.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker’s thought convey that getting the correct answer on Kids Jeopardy humorously boosts their confidence. It also suggests that their usual standards for self-esteem in trivia are perhaps not very high, or they don't frequently succeed in such situations.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is likely using humor or self-deprecation to discuss their feelings. It suggests that they are aware of the simplicity of the accomplishment but are choosing to playfully acknowledge its impact on their self-esteem. The statement appears lighthearted and not intended to be taken entirely seriously.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies that they find humor or satisfaction in correctly answering a question on a children’s version of Jeopardy, perhaps indicating a struggle with more challenging versions.
  
- **Presuppositions**: It is assumed that Kids Jeopardy is easier than standard Jeopardy, and thus, succeeding in it may not generally be considered a significant achievement.

- **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker, most likely engaging in self-deprecating humor, aims to entertain or amuse others by acknowledging the irony of finding confidence in this context.

- **Polarity**: The statement has a slightly negative tone masked by humor, as it subtly suggests that their self-esteem may typically require modest boosts.

- **Pretense**: The speaker is likely pretending to have a certain pride in their accomplishment, knowing it is not as impressive as it might initially sound. 

- **Meaning**: While literally stating that such a victory boosts self-esteem, the implied meaning is that it humorously highlights a low bar for their self-esteem in trivia.

Reflecting on this analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic as it uses humor and irony to express a self-deprecating sentiment regarding the level of intellectual challenge they find to be gratifying.

"What a golden morning. 😒 #not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the morning is not as great or "golden" as one might expect or as they sarcastically suggest. The use of the word "golden" followed by the sarcastic emoji and hashtag suggests that the reality of the morning is quite the opposite.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks the morning is unpleasant or disappointing in some way. The use of sarcasm and the slightly negative emoji indicates dissatisfaction or annoyance.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts suggest that the morning is not enjoyable and is being presented sarcastically.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude as a form of sarcasm. The actual sentiment is negative, but they express it through a sarcastic positive statement.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "What a golden morning. 😒 #not" is deeply sarcastic. The implicature here is that the morning is not "golden" or pleasant despite the literal wording suggesting otherwise. The presupposition is that calling something "golden" typically implies it's excellent or beautiful, but the speaker relies on the audience to understand this is not the case through the contrasting emoji and hashtag. The intent of the speaker seems to be to convey their dissatisfaction or frustration with the morning while using sarcasm to add humor or emphasis.

The polarity of the statement is negative, indicated by the emoji and the hashtag "#not". The pretense is evident as the speaker mocks the idea of a "golden morning" by pretending to have a positive outlook, only to reveal the opposite. The literal meaning of the statement suggests a beautiful morning, but the implied meaning, emphasized by the emoji and hashtag, conveys that the morning is, in fact, bad or irritating in some way.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, nothing significant should change. The analysis accurately captures the sarcasm intended by the speaker. Thus, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"that bump off the apron looked like it hurt.. was that padding u landed on? #sarcasm"

- The speaker implies that the impact from the bump off the apron was tough or painful, and they suggest the landing surface was not padded, despite asking it sarcastically.
- The speaker likely thinks the landing was hard and possibly painful and uses sarcasm to emphasize how little protection the surface provided.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are saying the same thing: the impact was not cushioned, and was likely painful, highlighted by sarcasm.
- The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; their sarcasm indicates genuine acknowledgment of the rough nature of the landing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "that bump off the apron looked like it hurt.. was that padding u landed on? #sarcasm" implies that the bump was painful and that the landing surface was not padded, despite the question about padding being posed sarcastically. The presupposition is that landing on an apron is expected to be cushioned, but the speaker implies this was not the case. The speaker's intent is to highlight the severity of the impact and possibly criticize the lack of protective padding. The tone is negative, as it points out potential negligence in providing adequate protection. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; the sarcasm indicates sincerity in acknowledging the harsh landing.

The literal meaning suggests a question about padding, but the implied meaning, bolstered by the hashtag #sarcasm, suggests the absence of padding and indicates pain or discomfort.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is clearly sarcastic, as it uses irony to stress the lack of padding and the resultant harsh impact. The analysis accurately identifies the sarcastic nature of the statement, which should not change.

The statement is: "Ah yes. Just what I wanted today- a pounding migraine. #Sarcasm"

- The speaker implies that a migraine is the opposite of what they wanted. They did not desire or anticipate having a migraine today, and it is an unwelcome occurrence.
- The speaker thinks that the situation is unpleasant and frustrating. They are likely dissatisfied or irritated by having a migraine.
- What the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are saying the same thing. Both indicate that the migraine is unwanted and bothersome.
- The speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude toward the migraine, as indicated by the sarcasm. However, their true attitude is negative, and the sarcasm underscores their displeasure.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Ah yes. Just what I wanted today- a pounding migraine. #Sarcasm" is clearly sarcastic. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies dissatisfaction. They are actually displeased about having a migraine, despite the literal words suggesting it's something they wanted.

- **Presuppositions**: The underlying assumption is that no one desires a migraine. The speaker presumes that the audience will understand that having a migraine is undesirable.

- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker uses sarcasm to express frustration and annoyance, likely seeking empathy or commiseration from the audience.

- **Polarity**: The tone of the sentence is negative, as evidenced by the unwelcome nature of the condition being described (a migraine).

- **Pretense**: There is a pretense of gratitude or desire for the migraine, as signaled by the sarcastic comment. However, the underlying attitude is negative.

- **Meaning**: The literal meaning (that the speaker wanted a migraine) is contradicted by the implied meaning (that a migraine is unwanted). The hashtag "#Sarcasm" also directly signals the use of sarcasm to highlight the contradiction.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker's intent is to communicate their displeasure and frustration through the pretense of expressing desire, which creates the sarcastic tone. No change is needed in the analysis conclusion.

"Get on the work bus, driver turns his music on and the first song on is 'another day in paradise' #irony"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?  
The speaker implies that there is a humorous or ironic contrast between the song titled 'Another Day in Paradise' playing as they commute to work on a bus. The song might typically evoke a sense of leisure or ideal living, which starkly contrasts with the mundane or less-than-ideal reality of their work commute.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?  
The speaker likely finds the situation amusing or somewhat sarcastically funny. By using the hashtag #irony, they highlight the discrepancy between the imagery or emotion the song might suggest versus the reality of riding a bus to work, suggesting that the bus ride does not feel like 'paradise' at all.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?  
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think revolves around the ironic mismatch between the song's theme and the actual experience of commuting, suggesting it’s the opposite of a 'day in paradise.'

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.  
The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude. Their use of the hashtag and statement suggests genuine amusement at the irony of the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement describes an ironic situation where the speaker gets on a bus for work while the song "Another Day in Paradise" plays, which contrasts humorously with the reality of commuting. The speaker implies this contrast is ironic, as the song’s theme of ideal living contrasts with the mundane reality of a work commute. They find the situation amusing and highlight it with the hashtag #irony. Both the inference and their perception converge on the humor found in the mismatch between the song and the commuting experience. There is no pretense; their tone is genuinely amused by the irony.

In analyzing the statement:
- The implicature highlights the humorous contrast between the song and the commute.
- The presupposition is that commuting to work is far from paradisiacal.
- The intent is to share the humor in the ironic situation with others.
- The tone is positive due to the amusement rather than frustration.
- No pretense is evident in the speaker's attitude.

The literal and implied meanings differ: the literal experience of riding the work bus contrasts with the 'paradise' suggested by the song. Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the sarcastic tone is clear as the speaker uses irony to point out the absurdity of the situation, even if they're genuinely amused. Thus, the statement is sarcastic.

"I wonder how many people who visit food banks have huge TVs or are drunks? #freedomofspeech #foodbanks"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that people who use food banks may not be financially incapable of buying food due to possible misuse of their money on unnecessary or indulgent items, like large TVs or alcohol.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

The statement questions the financial priorities of individuals who visit food banks by implying that these individuals may possess large TVs or indulge in alcohol, suggesting mismanagement of their finances rather than genuine need. The speaker appears skeptical about the necessity of food banks for their users, hinting that some users might not be in as dire financial need as presumed. Both the implication and the speaker's thought reflect a critical attitude, expressing doubt about the appropriate use of food banks without any pretense of pretending to hold this view.

**Analysis:**

**Implicature:** The statement implies that those using food banks may prioritize non-essential items over essentials like food.

**Presuppositions:** There's an assumption that owning large TVs or consuming alcohol is inconsistent with genuine financial struggle.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker hopes to express skepticism or critique of perceived misuse of food banks by suggesting that some users might be financially irresponsible.

**Polarity:** The tone is negative, displaying doubt or a lack of trust in the users of food banks.

**Pretense:** There is no pretense detected; the speaker seems genuinely skeptical about the situation.

**Meaning:** The literal meaning questions the characteristics of food bank users, while the implied meaning suggests that these individuals may misuse funds or luxury items, undermining their need for assistance.

Given this analysis, while the statement contains skepticism and judgment, it is not inherently sarcastic. Instead, it expresses a genuine critical viewpoint without the use of irony or sarcasm. The speaker critically questions the priorities of food bank users, but without employing any sarcasm in their delivery.

"Access to housing is not a fundamental human right, according to Ontario courts: http://t.co/ykf7vB53RM #onpoli #TOpoli #cdnpoli"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is highlighting a decision made by Ontario courts regarding the status of housing as a human right. By sharing this, the speaker may be implying that there is a noteworthy or possibly controversial legal stance on the issue, potentially suggesting it is a point of concern or discussion within political circles.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
While the tweet itself does not directly express the speaker's personal opinion or provide specific commentary, the fact that it is shared along with political hashtags might suggest that they have an interest in the topic or believe it to be significant for political discourse.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
The implication leans towards the idea that there is something significant — potentially contentious or critical — about the Ontario courts' decision. However, without an explicitly stated opinion, it is not clear if the speaker agrees or disagrees with the decision, so their personal thoughts are not directly conveyed.

The speaker implies that this legal decision is significant enough to be highlighted and associated with political discussion, as shown by the use of political hashtags. The speaker does not provide an explicit opinion on the subject, which suggests they might want to provoke thought or debate among readers without revealing their stance. There's no pretense in the speaker's attitude, as the statement is framed factually.

**Analysis:**

- **Implicature**: The statement implies that the decision is potentially controversial or significant in political discourse.
- **Presuppositions**: It presupposes that the issue of housing as a human right is a topic of enough interest to warrant attention, especially in political discussions.
- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to inform or prompt discussion about the Ontario courts' decision, targeting those interested in political or social justice issues.
- **Polarity**: The tone is neutral; it is centered around reporting a fact without emotional input.
- **Pretense**: There is no pretense; the speaker presents the information straightforwardly.
- **Meaning**: The literal meaning aligns with the implied significance of the legal decision, though the speaker's lack of expressed opinion leaves the full meaning open to reader interpretation.

Intent: The speaker intends to communicate dissatisfaction or annoyance at being ignored by employing sarcasm to express their true feelings humorously.
Polarity: The tone of the statement is negative, as the speaker is unhappy about the situation.
Pretense: There is no pretense; the speaker's attitude is genuine in their dislike of being ignored, albeit expressed sarcastically.
Meaning: The literal meaning suggests enjoyment of being ignored, but the implied meaning, through sarcasm, is the opposite—displeasure at being ignored.

The analysis accurately identifies all aspects that point to sarcasm. The statement is indeed sarcastic, as it uses the opposite of the speaker’s true feelings to humorously emphasize their dislike for being ignored. Nothing significant needs change in the preliminary analysis.

"I didn't realize Boston Coach also operated in Chicago #irony #brands"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they find it ironic or unexpected that a company named "Boston Coach" is operating in a city that is not Boston, such as Chicago. The expectation might be that a company with a geographically-specific name would only operate in that location.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to be amused or surprised by the expansion of the Boston Coach brand into a city outside of Boston. The use of "#irony" indicates that they find a humorous contradiction in the company's name versus its operational reach.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the thought behind the statement express surprise and amusement at the geographical incongruence between the company's name and its operational reach.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a specific attitude. They genuinely seem to find the situation humorous or ironic and are sharing this observation with their audience using hashtags to emphasize the irony.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In the analysis, the statement expresses surprise and amusement at the geographical incongruity of a company named "Boston Coach" operating outside of Boston, specifically in Chicago. The speaker finds this situation humorous, as indicated by the use of "#irony" and "#brands" to highlight the perceived contradiction. 

To determine sarcasm:
- **Implicature**: The speaker implies that it's unexpected for a geographically-named company like "Boston Coach" to operate outside its titular city.
- **Presuppositions**: It is assumed that the listener knows "Boston" is a city, and logically, a company named after it would operate there.
- **Intent**: The speaker aims to convey humor by pointing out the brand's expansion in an unexpected manner.
- **Polarity**: The tone is lighthearted and slightly mocking, leaning towards negative but not harsh.
- **Pretense**: There is no pretense. The speaker shares their genuine amusement.
- **Literal vs. Implied**: Literally, the statement is about company operations, but it implies ridicule of brand naming conventions not aligning with business practices.

Reflecting on the analysis, there seems to be no pretense and the humor stems from genuine observation rather than a sarcastic jab. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic; it is an actual humorous observation about brand naming and geographic relevance.

"@mgutowski63 just check out the buttons, see what they do. And follow me back 😜"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that @mgutowski63 might be new or unfamiliar with certain features ("the buttons") on the platform, and is encouraging them to explore these features. Additionally, by encouraging them to follow them back, the speaker is implying an expectation of mutual interaction or reciprocity in following each other.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that @mgutowski63 might benefit from learning more about the platform's features and is using a light-hearted or humorous tone to suggest this. They also seem to expect or desire mutual following, which is indicated by their request to follow back.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think generally point towards encouraging exploration of the platform as well as indicating an interest in mutual following. The tone is light and playful, suggesting a casual and friendly suggestion rather than a critique or command.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; the use of the winking tongue-out emoji ("😜") suggests genuine playfulness and a friendly demeanor.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement is analyzed as follows:

**Implicature**: The speaker implies that @mgutowski63 is unfamiliar with platform features and encourages exploration, expecting mutual following.

**Presuppositions**: It is assumed that @mgutowski63 has not fully explored the features and is not yet following the speaker.

**Speaker's Intent**: The speaker aims to encourage exploration of features, form a reciprocal social connection, and maintain a playful interaction.

**Polarity**: The tone is positive, indicated by the playful emoji.

**Pretense**: There is no pretense; the speaker's playful demeanor seems genuine.

**Literal vs. Implied Meaning**: Literally, the statement suggests exploring buttons and mutual following. Implied is a friendly nudge to engage more with the platform and establish a reciprocal relationship.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the speaker's statement does not exhibit sarcasm. The playful and friendly tone, supported by the emoji, conveys a genuine suggestion rather than a sarcastic remark. The analysis is aligned with the intended atmosphere of light-heartedness and engagement.

"Reunited with my pump this morning. #yay #not 😣"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that reuniting with their pump is not a desirable or enjoyable situation.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to have a negative attitude toward the situation, as indicated by the mixed use of "yay" with "not" and the frowny emoji.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the explicit statement convey a lack of enthusiasm or frustration about having to use the pump again.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker uses sarcasm, as seen in "#yay #not" to express their true feelings, exaggerating a positive sentiment to actually convey dissatisfaction. They aren't outright pretending to be happy; instead, they're using humor to communicate their displeasure.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The Implicature - The speaker implies that being reunited with their pump is not a positive experience, despite using terms typically associated with positivity like "yay."

The Presuppositions - It is taken for granted that the speaker was previously separated from their pump and that this reunification is something significant enough to mention.

The intent of the speaker - The speaker intends to humorously express dissatisfaction or frustration about needing to use the pump again. The speaker is likely someone who regularly uses a pump, perhaps for medical or lifestyle reasons, and they are sharing their personal frustration in a relatable or humorous way. 

The polarity - The concluding sentiment of "#yay #not 😣" has a negative tone due to the hashtag reversal and the frowny emoji, which contrasts with the word "yay."

Pretense - There is pretense in the sense that the initial positive term "yay" is immediately undercut by "not," showing the speaker's true negative sentiment.

Meaning - The literal statement suggests a happy reunion, but the implied meaning, supported by the "not" and the emoji, is dissatisfaction or annoyance.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement relies heavily on sarcasm. The hashtags and emoji clearly signal that the speaker's real feelings are contrary to the initial "yay," emphasizing their displeasure rather than joy. Therefore, the statement is sarcastic.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely thinks that having three exams in one day is overwhelming or stressful. They likely view it as a negative experience and are using sarcasm as a way to cope or express their dissatisfaction.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's actual thoughts suggest that the situation is not pleasant or enjoyable, despite the initially positive tone.

Finally, the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the situation, as indicated by their use of sarcasm. The enthusiastic phrasing is a facade to express the opposite feeling.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "I have three exams today lets gooooo! #School #Sarcasm #Swag" indicates sarcasm, as suggested by the hashtag "#Sarcasm." The speaker implies that having three exams in one day is not exciting, contrary to the enthusiastic wording. Presupposed is that having three exams is challenging or unfavorable. The speaker's intent appears to be expressing frustration or dissatisfaction humorously, using sarcasm to cope with the stress of the situation. The tone is negative, despite the seemingly positive phrasing, and there is pretense as the enthusiasm is not genuine.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the analysis is consistent, as both the implication and explicit acknowledgment of sarcasm align, confirming the statement's sarcastic nature.

The speaker states: "Just woken up after 16 hour night shift to no gas. Looks like microwave meal and cold shower for me today. Woo! #sarcasm #fml."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they are having a rough day. Having completed a demanding 16-hour night shift, they discovered that there was no gas available, which prevents them from cooking a proper meal or having a hot shower. The use of "Woo!" along with the hashtags "#sarcasm" and "#fml" suggests a sarcastic tone, indicating they find the situation frustrating or unfortunate.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely thinks that the situation is undesirable and inconvenient. They seem to feel exasperated by the fact that they cannot have a hot shower or a proper meal after an exhausting work shift, which contributes to an overall negative sentiment about their current circumstances.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think highlight their dissatisfaction and frustration with having no gas. The sarcasm used and hashtags indicate their disappointment and underline the adverse nature of the situation.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.

The speaker's statement conveys dissatisfaction and frustration due to discovering there's no gas after a grueling 16-hour night shift, leading to an undesired microwave meal and cold shower. The use of "Woo!" and hashtags "#sarcasm" and "#fml" clearly indicate sarcasm. The intent is to highlight the irony and annoyance of their situation by feigning excitement. Thus, the statement is sarcastic. The preliminary analysis effectively identifies the sarcasm through the implied dissatisfaction despite the literal wording of excitement. No changes are needed to this analysis; the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"@MoAnsar @LouiseMensch Talking to yourself again Mo #Irony"

- The speaker implies that Mo Ansar is engaging in a one-sided conversation, perhaps because others are not responding or because Mo's points are considered self-affirming or lacking engagement with others.
- The speaker thinks that Mo Ansar's comment or behavior reflects a lack of interaction or is redundant, possibly suggesting that Mo's arguments don't resonate with others or are not insightful.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "@MoAnsar @LouiseMensch Talking to yourself again Mo #Irony" implies that Mo Ansar is engaging in a conversation that lacks interaction or engagement from others, essentially speaking to himself. The presupposition is that Mo's comments or arguments are ineffective or perhaps not being acknowledged by the intended audience. The intent of the speaker seems to be to mock or criticize Mo Ansar by highlighting this perceived lack of engagement.

The polarity of the statement is negative, as it suggests ineffectiveness or redundancy in Mo's communication. There is a pretense in the speaker's attitude as they use the term "#Irony" which adds a layer of sarcasm, implying that Mo is unaware of the situation. The literal meaning suggests Mo is literally talking to himself, but the implied meaning is that Mo's points are not resonating with others or that his engagement is perceived as self-affirming without genuine interaction.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it captures the implied sarcasm effectively. The statement is indeed sarcastic, as it uses irony to critique Mo Ansar's communication style. The speaker's use of irony and insinuation suggests that they do not view Mo's conversation as meaningful or successful.

"This long drive home later in the snow is gonna be shweeeet #not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are anticipating a difficult or unpleasant experience driving home in the snow. The use of "shweeeet" sarcastically implies that this experience is going to be particularly challenging, stressful, or bothersome.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks negatively about the situation. They do not look forward to the drive and expect it to be anything but enjoyable.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. They both suggest a negative attitude towards the prospect of driving in snow.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is employing sarcasm ("shweeeet") but not pretending to have a different attitude. Instead, the sarcasm underscores their negative feelings about the upcoming drive.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker sarcastically implies that the drive will not be enjoyable by using the word "shweeeet" to ironically describe the anticipated unpleasantness of driving home in snow. The presupposition is that driving in snow is generally understood to be difficult or stressful. The speaker's intent is to express their dissatisfaction or dread about the situation to their audience, likely seeking empathy or understanding. The polarity of the statement is negative, as it conveys displeasure about the expected experience. There is a pretense in the speaker's attitude, highlighted by the sarcastic use of "shweeeet," which contrasts the positive connotation of the word with the reality of the context. 

Overall, the analysis is correct. The statement is indeed sarcastic as it uses irony to emphasize the speaker's negative anticipation of the snowy drive. The implied meaning is that the drive is not going to be sweet, enjoyable, or pleasant at all, contrary to the literal meaning suggested by "shweeeet." Thus, the preliminary analysis doesn't require any changes, and the statement should be concluded as sarcastic.

Statement: "Been friendzoned too many times in my life, the perks of being the good guy #Sarcasm #Life all my life this has happened"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that being a "good guy" has consistently led to being placed in the "friend zone" rather than in romantic relationships. The use of "#Sarcasm" suggests that the speaker finds this situation ironic or unfair.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears to be frustrated with being friendzoned repeatedly and perceives being a "good guy" as a factor that contributes to this outcome.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the speaker's implication through sarcasm aligns with their actual feelings of dissatisfaction and frustration regarding their experiences in the context of relationships.

Finally, regarding whether the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation:
The use of sarcasm indicates a level of pretense in attitude. While the speaker is frustrated, they use sarcasm to express that frustration rather than directly stating dissatisfaction, possibly to soften the impact or to add humor to their expression of disappointment.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement by @DuaneBougard suggests that being a "good guy" consistently results in friendzoning, which the speaker finds ironic or unfair, as indicated by the use of "#Sarcasm." The speaker is frustrated with this repeated experience, linking it to being a "good guy." The sarcastic tone aligns with their underlying feelings of dissatisfaction, using sarcasm as a way to express these feelings humorously or to downplay the frustration.

Analysis:
1. **Implicature**: Being a good guy inherently results in unfavorable romantic outcomes.
2. **Presuppositions**: The friend zone is an undesirable outcome, and being a good person contributes to this specific relational outcome.
3. **Intent**: The speaker aims to share their frustration and perhaps elicit empathy from others who share similar experiences.
4. **Polarity**: Negative—the tone reflects dissatisfaction or disillusionment.
5. **Pretense**: The speaker uses sarcasm as a pretentious layer to express a genuine disappointment in being friendzoned.
6. **Meaning**: Literally, it would appear as if there are actual perks to being good, but the implied meaning is the opposite, highlighting the lack of perceived benefits.

Considering both the explicit mention of #Sarcasm and the analysis provided, the statement is sarcastic. The speaker deliberately contrasts the literal notion of 'perks' with their actual displeasure. The preliminary analysis aligns well, so no major changes are needed.

"Google scholarship application kept crashing in Chrome. Opened it in IE, finished application without incident. #irony"

- The speaker implies that there is an ironic or unexpected situation where a Google product (Chrome) is less reliable than its competing product (Internet Explorer) for completing a Google scholarship application.
- The speaker is likely frustrated or amused by the situation, as they point out the irony in successfully completing the application using a lesser-favored or outdated browser.
- What the speaker implies (irony of Chrome failing to complete a Google application) and what they think (amused or frustrated by the situation) are related but slightly distinct. The implication is about the irony, while their thinking might be a combination of mild frustration and amusement.
- It does not seem like the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. They genuinely seem to express a mix of amusement and frustration at the ironic situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

- **Implicature**: The statement suggests irony in the occurrence of a Google application failing in Google's own browser, Chrome, while succeeding in a competitor's browser, Internet Explorer.
- **Presuppositions**: It's assumed that Google Chrome is typically a more reliable or favored browser than Internet Explorer, especially for Google-related activities.
- **Intent**: The speaker wants to highlight the irony and perhaps express mild frustration or amusement regarding the failure of Chrome and the success of Internet Explorer in completing the application.
- **Polarity**: While there is no explicit positive or negative tone, the use of "#irony" suggests a negative tone in an amused or sardonic context.
- **Pretense**: There doesn't appear to be any pretense; the speaker's attitude is genuine, showing a mix of mild frustration and amusement.
- **Meaning**: Literally, the statement describes a technical incident. Implied is the irony of Google's product being outperformed by a rival's product.

**Reflection and Conclusion:**

The analysis effectively identifies the ironic element in the statement and notes the genuine mix of amusement and frustration from the speaker. There is an implicit criticism of Google's product's failure, despite it being subtle.

The statement is indeed sarcastic. Sarcasm is conveyed through the ironic juxtaposition of using a competitor's less popular product successfully over Google's own, combined with the use of "#irony".

The speaker states: "Jeez I wish the government paid for my food. #not #EBTbitches"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they do not actually wish for the government to pay for their food and seems to be criticizing or mocking those who receive government assistance via EBT (Electronic Benefits Transfer), which is typically used for food-related benefits like SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program).

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to have a negative opinion or disapproval toward the idea of the government paying for people's food. They seem to express disdain or judgment toward individuals who use EBT for their groceries.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the thought behind the statement are critical of government assistance programs and possibly those who rely on them.

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; they are straightforwardly expressing their disdain for government-funded food programs and/or individuals who benefit from them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement "Jeez I wish the government paid for my food. #not #EBTbitches" implies sarcasm, as the use of "#not" contradicts the literal desire for government aid. They express disdain for government assistance programs and those who benefit from them, implying that such assistance is undesirable or unearned. The speaker is likely criticizing or mocking individuals who use EBT and government food assistance programs.

In terms of analysis:

- Implicature: Despite the literal statement, the speaker doesn't wish for government aid and uses the hashtag "#not" to emphasize sarcasm. They imply criticism or judgment towards those receiving aid.
  
- Presuppositions: The speaker presupposes that government assistance programs like EBT exist to support people with food needs.

- Intent: The speaker intends to mock or criticize government assistance programs and recipients by sarcastically dismissing their benefit.

- Polarity: The sentence has a negative tone directed towards government assistance and its recipients.

- Pretense: There is no pretense; the speaker is directly expressing their negative sentiment, albeit sarcastically.

- Meaning: While the literal statement expresses a wish for government support, the implied meaning is the opposite, conveying disdain or criticism.

Based on this analysis, the statement is sarcastic because the literal meaning contrasts with the implied criticism of EBT users and government assistance programs. The preliminary analysis already highlights the sarcasm effectively, so no substantial changes are needed.

The tweet says: "@TonyRohrs they've spread their positions off with long feeder cattle! #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that someone is handling situations in a non-strategic, perhaps unwise manner. By using "long feeder cattle," it can mean they are investing or hedging a certain way that the speaker finds amusing or illogical.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to think that the situation, or the actions someone is taking, is absurd or nonsensical. The use of sarcasm indicates that the speaker believes the approaching strategy is not commendable or effective.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. Both suggest disbelief or amusement regarding someone's strategy involving "long feeder cattle."

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm to pretend to commend the strategy, but in reality, their attitude is one of mocking or criticizing the approach. They do not genuinely support or agree with it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In this tweet, the speaker uses sarcasm to criticize someone's strategy involving "long feeder cattle." The implicature suggests that the person in question is managing their positions or investments in a way that the speaker finds illogical or amusing. The presupposition is that there is a specific strategy being evaluated, and the speaker already sees it as ineffective. The speaker, potentially a market or financial commentator, aims to mock or highlight the absurdity of this strategy to their audience, including someone named Tony Rohrs. 

The polarity of the sentence is negative, as indicated by the use of sarcasm. The pretense in the speaker's attitude is evident—they pretend to commend the strategy through their literal words while actually ridiculing it. The literal meaning of "spread their positions off with long feeder cattle" appears neutral or descriptive, but the implied meaning is critical and mocking, as reinforced by the hashtag "#sarcasm."

Reflecting on the analysis, the use of sarcasm is evident due to the contrast between the literal words and the mocking implied meaning. The statement is clearly sarcastic, as the speaker employs a tone of ridicule through their opposition to the strategy being discussed. The preliminary analysis effectively captures the sarcastic intent of the tweet.

"30 years on, people still haven't got justice they deserve. #BhopalGasTragedy Yet another brilliant job done by the Americans #sarcasm"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that justice has been delayed or denied to the victims of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, even after 30 years. The mention of "yet another brilliant job done by the Americans" implies that the speaker holds the American entities involved in the tragedy responsible or at least partially accountable, suggesting negligence or inadequate actions taken by them.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker believes the situation is unjust and possibly feels frustrated or disillusioned by the lack of action or accountability. The use of sarcasm indicates they likely feel that the response (or lack thereof) by American entities was inadequate and not genuinely "brilliant."

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they are aligned. Both the implication and the speaker’s thoughts reflect a sentiment of injustice and dissatisfaction with the handling of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, particularly focusing on the perceived role of American entities.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is using sarcasm to express disdain or criticism toward the American involvement or handling of the situation. The hashtag "sarcasm" indicates that the phrase "another brilliant job" should not be taken at face value and that the speaker genuinely feels the exact opposite.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis gives a detailed breakdown of the speaker's statement, highlighting the use of sarcasm to express criticism. Let's assess the elements further:

1. **Implicature:** The speaker implies that the American response to the Bhopal Gas Tragedy was inadequate and continues to be so since the victims have not received the justice they deserve even after 30 years.

2. **Presuppositions:** The conversation presupposes that there is a problem with the justice delivered (or not delivered) to the Bhopal Gas Tragedy victims and that American entities have a significant role in this ongoing issue.

3. **Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker aims to criticize and draw attention to the lack of justice for Bhopal Gas Tragedy victims. By including "another brilliant job done by the Americans," they specifically call out perceived American failures.

4. **Polarity:** The final sentence, despite using the word "brilliant," has a negative tone due to the context and the use of sarcasm.

5. **Pretense:** There is clear pretense in the speaker's attitude. The speaker uses sarcasm to pretend to praise the Americans, but they actually mean to criticize them harshly.

6. **Meaning:** The literal meaning suggests commendation, but the implied meaning is one of criticism and frustration. The hashtag #sarcasm makes this discord explicit.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it effectively captures the speaker's use of sarcasm. The statement is clearly sarcastic as the literal praise for "another brilliant job" contrasts sharply with the implied criticism regarding American involvement in the tragedy. The analysis does not require significant changes. The statement is indeed sarcastic.

The tweet says: "@RailwaySloth u do really need to get a wee bit more lol"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that @RailwaySloth is lacking something that they should obtain more of. The "lol" at the end suggests they are making this suggestion in a light-hearted or joking manner.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the thought suggest that @RailwaySloth needs to acquire more of something, though it is not specified, and the tone appears to be playful or teasing.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**The Implicature**: The statement implies that @RailwaySloth is lacking something, and the speaker suggests they should get more of it. However, the exact object or concept that needs to be increased is unclear.

**The Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that @RailwaySloth currently has or engages with this unspecified thing in some capacity, but not to a sufficient extent.

**The Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to tease or gently mock @RailwaySloth in a playful way, as suggested by the use of "lol," indicating a jest rather than a serious critique.

**The Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence, particularly with "lol," is positive, suggesting a joking or playful attitude.

**Pretense**: There does not seem to be pretense in the speaker's attitude. The light-hearted tone appears genuine.

**Meaning**: The literal meaning is a suggestion that @RailwaySloth acquire more of whatever "it" is. The implied meaning is a playful jab that they are currently not getting or doing enough of something, but the vagueness and "lol" soften any potential criticism.

Based on this, the statement is likely sarcastic. The speaker is using sarcasm in a light-hearted manner, implying something opposite of a serious recommendation because the vagueness and jovial tone highlight a jest rather than a genuine call for action.

The statement "A burned tongue is a lovely way to start the day #sarcasm #ouch" clearly uses sarcasm, indicated directly by the hashtag "#sarcasm". The speaker is implying the opposite of what they literally state, in that burning their tongue is certainly not a "lovely" experience. The use of "#ouch" further underscores the discomfort and unpleasantness of the situation, reinforcing their negative feelings toward it.

The implicature here is that the experience is undesirable, despite the literal wording suggesting it's "lovely". The speaker presupposes that the audience will understand the irony thanks to the explicit signaling of sarcasm and the cultural understanding of sarcasm as a means to express dissatisfaction or annoyance.

The speaker's intent is to humorously convey the discomfort and frustration of having burned their tongue. They initially present a feigned positive attitude by calling the experience "lovely", intending for their audience to recognize the sarcasm. The polarity of the last sentence is negative, given the negative connotations of "ouch" and the entire sarcastic construction.

The pretense is present in that the speaker is pretending to appreciate something they do not, using sarcasm as a tool to express their true feelings about the scenario, which are discomfort and irritation.

Considering this preliminary analysis, there isn't much that needs to change as the analysis aligns well with the components outlined. The statement is indeed sarcastic, intended to humorously express displeasure with the situation.

The statement is: "My dad's still gonna get me santa's gifts since it's my last year before 18, but I really don't know what to ask for... #irony"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies a sense of conflict or contradiction in their statement. By using the hashtag "#irony", they signal a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of the irony in the situation of still receiving "Santa's gifts" as they are soon to be considered an adult.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to find humor or amusement in the fact that they are still receiving gifts supposedly from Santa at their age. They also convey an uncertainty or lack of necessity for the gifts, evidenced by their remark about not knowing what to ask for.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think suggest a playful recognition of the unusualness or humorousness of the situation. They acknowledge the tradition with a sense of irony, while expressing an underlying understanding that they are growing out of it.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
It does not seem that the speaker is pretending to have a different attitude; they appear to be genuinely expressing their lighthearted acceptance of a tradition that feels outdated due to their age.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement carries a tone of playful irony regarding the tradition of receiving "Santa's gifts" at the cusp of adulthood. The hashtag "#irony" reflects the humorous contradiction in maintaining a childhood tradition while nearing 18, an age associated with leaving such traditions behind. The speaker highlights the humor by juxtaposing their expectation of receiving gifts with the uncertainty of what to even ask for, signaling a lack of necessity for the gifts due to their impending adulthood.

The implicature suggests that despite the speaker’s approaching adulthood, they’re humorously engaging with the tradition, acknowledging the paradox without explicitly stating it. The presupposition is that most people give up on the concept of Santa’s gifts as they grow older, yet the speaker's family continues this practice. The intent appears to be acknowledging the tradition’s humor rather than seeking to convince the audience of their need for gifts.

The polarity of the statement is neutral to positive, due to the lighthearted tone. There is minimal pretense; the speaker’s attitude reflects genuine amusement rather than dissonance between belief and expression. The literal meaning discusses getting gifts, while the implied meaning humorously challenges the appropriateness of this childhood tradition for someone nearly 18. 

The preliminary analysis correctly identifies the speaker's genuine amusement and irony, and confirms that the statement is indeed sarcastic. The irony is emphasized by the hashtag, making clear the speaker’s playful acknowledgment of the tradition’s incongruity with their age.

"Decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it. -Bill Cosby|#irony"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that overcoming fear or hesitation is crucial to achieving goals or desires. They use a quote attributed to Bill Cosby to highlight this point and then add "#irony," suggesting some underlying contradiction or humorous juxtaposition between the statement and the speaker.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely believes there's a sharp contrast between the public persona of Bill Cosby, as someone who might offer motivational advice, and the controversy or legal issues surrounding him, which makes the quote ironic in their opinion. The use of "irony" indicates they find it contradictory or humorous given Cosby's history.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both imply that while the statement on its own might hold truth or wisdom, quoting Bill Cosby in this context creates a sense of irony due to his controversial background.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is likely not pretending; rather, they are explicitly expressing a sense of irony or sarcasm by juxtaposing the motivational quote with the connotation of Bill Cosby's public controversies.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis points out that the speaker uses Bill Cosby's quote "Decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it" and labels it with "#irony" due to the contradiction between Cosby's intended motivational meaning and his controversial past. The statement implies that achieving goals requires overcoming fear, but the presence of "#irony" suggests the speaker finds humor in the contradiction, given Cosby's legal issues. The pretense lies not in the speaker’s attitude but in the contrast between the literal motivational advice and the implied inappropriate source. The tone of the statement is negative due to the connotation the hashtag introduces.

Reflecting on this, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker uses the quote from a controversial figure to highlight the irony rather than genuine admiration for the motivational advice, emphasizing the juxtaposition through "#irony." The intent is not to motivate but to underscore the humor or irony in sourcing wisdom from someone like Bill Cosby given his past.

The statement is: "Once again @BarackObama is re writing history re: #CubaEmbargo ! *primal scream* #tcot"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that Barack Obama is altering the historical narrative or facts regarding the Cuba embargo issue. They express frustration or anger, as indicated by the "*primal scream*".

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to be frustrated or dissatisfied with Barack Obama's portrayal or changes in the narrative concerning the Cuba embargo. The use of "*primal scream*" suggests a strong emotional reaction.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thought convey a dissatisfaction with Obama's representation of history concerning the Cuba embargo. Both indicate a level of frustration or disagreement with his actions or statements.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
  The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude. The use of emotive language suggests a genuine feeling of frustration or anger toward Obama's actions or statements on this issue.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Preliminary analysis of the statement:

The Implicature: The speaker implies that Barack Obama is distorting or altering the historical account of the Cuba embargo, suggesting inaccuracy or bias in his representation.

The Presuppositions: It is taken for granted that Obama often addresses or represents historical narratives that contrast with the speaker's view. There's also an assumption that the "re-writing" is a negative action.

The intent of the speaker: The speaker, likely a critic of Obama, intends to express a strong dislike or disapproval of Obama's actions or statements regarding the Cuba embargo. They aim to convey their frustration to their audience and possibly influence others to share their viewpoint.

The polarity: The last sentence conveys a negative tone, evident from the "*primal scream*" and the context around "re-writing history."

Pretense: There is little to no pretense in the speaker's attitude; the frustration appears authentic, as evidenced by their choice of language.

Meaning: While the literal statement refers to Obama "re-writing history," the implied meaning suggests Obama's actions are either misguided or misleading, particularly in the eyes of the speaker.

Reflection on the preliminary analysis:
- The detailed breakdown accurately captures the speaker's intent and emotional tone. The negative sentiment is well identified.

Final decision: Based on the analysis, the statement is sarcastic. The use of "Once again" and "re-writing history" implies the speaker does not genuinely believe Obama is actually documenting history but rather misrepresenting it, potentially to manipulate or create a favorable impression. This indicates sarcasm as they do not mean to commend Obama but criticize him under the guise of those words.

The tweet states: "Did you know iOS 8 features custom keyboards? #sarcasm http://t.co/JhuwHjleiu"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is being sarcastic when they mention the feature of custom keyboards in iOS 8. The use of the hashtag #sarcasm suggests that this information is either well-known, outdated, or perhaps overhyped, implying that it should be common knowledge by now.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely believes that the information regarding custom keyboards in iOS 8 is either obvious, trivial, or has been excessively discussed. They seem to feel that there is no need to reiterate such a well-known feature.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think align in emphasizing that the information is not groundbreaking or noteworthy. The use of sarcasm communicates that the speaker considers the statement to be redundant.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is pretending to have a genuine curiosity or excitement about iOS 8's custom keyboards. The use of sarcasm indicates that their true attitude is dismissive or possibly tired of hearing about this feature.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker uses the hashtag #sarcasm to highlight that the information about iOS 8 featuring custom keyboards is neither new nor exciting. The implicature is that this feature is either widely known, outdated, or unnecessarily emphasized. The presupposition is that the audience is already familiar with this information. The speaker's intent is to mock the discussion about this feature, indicating that it is over-discussed or not as significant as it might have been presented. The polarity of the statement is negative, as it dismisses the relevance of the information. There is pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they mockingly present a question as if it were of genuine interest or novelty, which it is not. The difference between the literal and implied meaning further supports the sarcasm, as the speaker does not actually believe the information is noteworthy.

The preliminary analysis holds that the statement is sarcastic, and no change is necessary in this conclusion.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they are participating in the Rapha Festive 500 challenge and have completed 50 kilometers. They also imply that the break for coffee is welcome, especially as it helps them recover from the cold, as their toes are "coming back to life."

- What does the speaker think about the situation?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

The speaker is actively participating in the Rapha Festive 500 challenge and shares a moment of respite 50 kilometers into the ride by stopping for coffee. The implication here is the need to warm up and recover from the cold weather conditions, as highlighted by the mention of their toes "coming back to life." This statement conveys a sense of relief and possibly a mild sense of humor regarding their cold experience. The overarching tone is positive, indicating genuine enjoyment and relief, with no hint of sarcasm or pretense.

**Analysis:**

- **Implicature:** It is implied that they are taking a break from a physically demanding activity, which is also cold, thus marking the significance of the coffee break.
- **Presuppositions:** There is an assumption that the reader understands the context of the Rapha Festive 500 and that cycling in cold weather can leave extremities, like toes, feeling numb.
- **Intent:** The speaker's intent is to share a personal anecdote, highlighting a moment of relief and satisfaction during the challenge. The participants are likely fellow cyclists or enthusiasts who understand the context of such an event.
- **Polarity:** The tone of the statement is positive, indicating contentment and pleasure from the coffee break.
- **Pretense:** There is no pretense; the speaker genuinely expresses the joy and comfort of the break.
- **Meaning:** The literal meaning describes a coffee break during a long cycling event, while the implied meaning highlights the enjoyment and relief from the cold conditions.

The preliminary analysis correctly identifies the statement as non-sarcastic. There is no discrepancy between the literal and implied meaning nor any pretense in the speaker's sentiment. The expression of relief and satisfaction after enduring cold conditions is genuine, therefore the statement is not sarcastic.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

The statement expresses shock and surprise that an NFL Rams player who previously participated in a symbolic "Hands Up, Don't Shoot" protest has been arrested.

- **Presuppositions**: The speaker takes for granted that the player's past actions were sincere efforts for justice.

"Murdered baby, black man in US, kids in Thailand and a woman's body in Avon gorge. It's a jolly day for news today #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the news is filled with grim, tragic, and serious events, and they find it disheartening or overwhelming. The use of "It's a jolly day for news today" and the hashtag "#sarcasm" suggests the opposite sentiment, emphasizing the negative and somber nature of the current events being reported.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely finds the news tragic, distressing, and possibly exhausting or frustrating due to the nature of the events mentioned. They seem to be disillusioned or critical of the state of affairs being reported, suggesting that it is not a "jolly" or pleasant experience.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they likely think are on the same line. The implication of sarcasm indicates their true negative sentiment about the news, which would align with finding the reported events troubling and not cheerful.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is sarcastically pretending to have a "jolly" attitude toward the situation, but this is a clear rhetorical device to highlight the opposite feeling. They are not genuinely expressing joy but instead using sarcasm to emphasize their critical view of the distressing nature of the news.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

The speaker uses sarcasm to express their dismay and criticism of the gloomy and tragic news stories reported that day. By stating "It's a jolly day for news today" followed by "#sarcasm," they clearly imply the opposite—emphasizing the distressing and grim nature of the news items mentioned (a murdered baby, a black man in the US, kids in Thailand, and a woman's body in Avon gorge). The implication is that these events are far from "jolly," revealing the speaker's negative sentiment towards the nature of the news coverage. There is a pretend cheerful attitude which serves only as a rhetorical device highlighting their actual critical and disheartened stance.

**Analysis:**

- **Implicature:** The news is filled with tragic and serious events, contrary to the speaker's surface-level statement of it being a "jolly day."
- **Presuppositions:** News content is typically expected to be serious and challenging when talking about murders and deaths.
- **Intent of Speaker:** To criticize the overwhelming negativity and tragedy in the news, possibly expressing frustration or exhaustion.
- **Polarity:** Negative tone due to the nature of the tragic events discussed.
- **Pretense:** Yes, there is pretense in the sarcastic expression of it being a "jolly" day.
- **Literal vs. Implied Meaning:** The literal meaning states it's a cheerful news day, but the implied meaning highlights distress towards the reports.

Given this analysis, it is evident that the statement is indeed sarcastic. The preliminary analysis is accurate and thorough, depicting the sarcastic nature of the tweet in reflecting the speaker's true negative feelings about the reported news. No changes are necessary.

"Seriously has the #BBL04 got the tallest on ground interviewers of all time #talltowers #sevenfoot"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the interviewers for the #BBL04 (Big Bash League 04) seem exceptionally tall, possibly even taller than what is typically expected for on-ground interviewers.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears amused or surprised by the height of the interviewers, enough to comment on it and use hashtags like #talltowers and #sevenfoot to emphasize the extreme height.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are aligned; they find the height of the interviewers notably tall and worth pointing out with some humor.

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; they are genuinely sharing an observation in a lighthearted manner.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis explores the speaker's observation about the height of the on-ground interviewers at the #BBL04 and humorously suggests they might be the tallest ever. However, the analysis doesn't explore sarcasm.

By examining the statement:

1. **Implicature**: It implies an exaggerated curiosity or astonishment about the unusual height of the interviewers.

2. **Presuppositions**: It assumes a typical height for on-ground interviewers, thereby highlighting the interviewers' height as an anomaly.

3. **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker intends to humorously emphasize the interviewers' height, possibly to entertain or engage the audience with light-hearted commentary.

4. **Polarity**: The tone is positive, focusing on amusement or surprise rather than criticism.

5. **Pretense**: There is no significant pretense, as the speaker is genuinely pointing out the observation without an underlying satirical attitude.

6. **Literal vs Implied Meaning**: Literally, the statement questions the height of interviewers. Implied, it humorously suggests that they're much taller than expected, without actual skepticism. 

Given the analysis, the comment doesn’t appear sarcastic because it aligns the literal observation of tall interviewers with a playful or amused tone without underlying mockery or irony. The analysis could emphasize that the lighthearted nature of the commentary is devoid of sarcasm.

The tweet is: "@KaylaBattaglia thanks I thought it was tomorrow #not #iknow #notthepoint"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there was some event or task they believed was scheduled for tomorrow, but they have since learned it is not and are thanking someone, presumably Kayla, for clarifying this misunderstanding.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to acknowledge that they misunderstood the timing of whatever they were referring to. Although they say "thanks," the use of hashtags like #not and #notthepoint suggest a hint of sarcasm or frustration. They might feel annoyed that their misunderstanding isn't the central issue.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Not entirely. While the speaker implies appreciation with a "thanks," their additional commentary via hashtags suggests their actual feelings might lean more towards sarcasm or frustration about the misunderstanding or its relevance.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, it seems the speaker is pretending to be sincerely grateful with the "thanks." The hashtags undermine this sincerity, indicating that while they're acknowledging the help, their actual attitude might be more flustered or irritated than grateful.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis of the tweet suggests the following:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies they were mistaken about the timing of an event or task, which they thought was scheduled for tomorrow. Kayla's clarification corrected their misunderstanding.

2. **Presuppositions**: It is assumed that there was a previous interaction where Kayla informed or corrected the speaker about the timing.

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker's primary intent seems to be acknowledging the correction but with a tone that suggests sarcasm or frustration rather than sincere gratitude. The speaker is likely trying to convey a sense of mild annoyance or irony.

4. **Polarity**: The tone appears negative due to the use of the hashtags, which suggest sarcasm.

5. **Pretense**: There is pretense in the gratitude expressed. The "thanks" appears insincere, as the hashtags (#not #notthepoint) contradict the gratitude, indicating a sarcastic undertone.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning is a thank you for correcting a misunderstanding. However, the implied meaning, as revealed through the sarcastic hashtags, is that the speaker doesn't find the correction especially important or is frustrated by it.

Reflecting on this analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. While there is a literal expression of thanks, the accompanying hashtags indicate that the speaker is not genuinely appreciative but rather expressing frustration or irony about the situation. The analysis correctly identifies the pretense and negative polarity that characterize sarcasm.

The statement is: "What a lovely day to drive #not #boo #fog #work 😳😳😳 http://t.co/tjJkA1yhq6"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that the day is not actually lovely for driving, as indicated by their use of irony ("#not") and the negative hashtags (#boo #fog #work). They are suggesting that the weather or conditions are poor for driving, possibly due to fog.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker is likely frustrated or annoyed by the current driving conditions, specifically the fog and having to go to work under such conditions. The use of sarcasm ("What a lovely day to drive") and the emojis (😳😳😳) suggest discomfort or unease.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts reflect a negative view of the day's driving conditions.

Finally, the speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. The use of sarcasm and negative hashtags reflect their genuine dissatisfaction with the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement, "What a lovely day to drive #not #boo #fog #work," implies that instead of being a lovely day for driving, the day is actually unpleasant due to fog and the necessity of going to work. The sarcasm is achieved by the ironic phrase "What a lovely day" followed immediately by "#not," indicating the opposite of what is literally stated. The hashtags (#boo, #fog, #work) emphasize the negative aspects of the day such as dissatisfaction with the weather and having to work. The emojis (😳😳😳) further convey discomfort or alarm.

The implicature suggests irony as the statement's literal meaning contrasts sharply with the implied dissatisfaction. The presupposition is that driving in foggy conditions to work is frustrating. The speaker's intent seems to be to express their displeasure or to commiserate with others in similar situations. The last sentence possesses a negative tone due to the contradiction between the literal statement and the hashtags. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they express genuine dissatisfaction.

After reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic, as the literal and implied meanings are contradictory, showcasing the speaker's true negative feelings about the day's driving conditions.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker intends to express confidence and possibly challenge norms or criticisms by inviting judgment. They aim to communicate that they embrace a trendy or youthful style and do not care for the opinions of those who might judge them for it.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

The statement is: "i may have played a part, but i wont take sole credit ;) @Hankin57 @Chief1787"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  By saying they "played a part," the speaker is acknowledging that they were involved in some capacity regarding the situation being discussed. However, by stating "but I won't take sole credit," they imply that others are also responsible or contributed significantly to the outcome. The use of the winking emoticon suggests a light-hearted or playful attitude, possibly joking or not entirely serious about the attribution of credit.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker believes they contributed to whatever is being talked about but stresses that they do not want to be seen as the only one responsible. They are pointing out that others, potentially @Hankin57 and @Chief1787, are involved and deserve recognition as well. It indicates a sense of humility or perhaps camaraderie.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, the speaker's implication and thoughts align as they both revolve around the idea of shared contributions rather than sole responsibility or credit.

The speaker doesn't appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude. The use of the winking emoticon suggests that while there is a seriousness to their claim of shared credit, there is also a playful, perhaps joking manner to it. They genuinely acknowledge the shared effort, but are likely being casual or light-hearted about the acknowledgment.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The primary analysis indicates that the statement implies shared contribution and credit for an outcome, involving the speaker and possibly @Hankin57 and @Chief1787. The speaker's tone suggests humility and camaraderie, with a hint of playfulness indicated by the winking emoticon. There's no evident pretense; the speaker seems genuine in recognizing the shared effort, albeit in a light-hearted manner. The literal and implied meanings align, as both suggest the acknowledgment of others' roles in the situation.

Considering the above analysis, the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker's intent is to acknowledge shared responsibility, and the wink may merely indicate a playful tone rather than irony or sarcasm. There are no contradictions between the literal and implied meanings, and the speaker appears sincere in crediting others. The statement's tone is positive, reflecting inclusivity and collaboration rather than sarcasm or negativity.

The speaker is expressing surprise and bewilderment that WWE wrestling continues to maintain its popularity over the years, even to the extent that their friends are attending a show. They mention their personal disconnect, as they stopped watching over a decade ago.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are experiencing nausea or vomiting early in the morning, which is clearly an unpleasant situation for them. They use sarcasm ('exactly what I want to be doing') to express dissatisfaction.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker is using sarcasm to convey their displeasure with being sick and throwing up at 7:30 am. They imply that being sick is not what they actually want, despite the literal wording suggesting otherwise. The presupposition is that throwing up early in the morning is undesirable and inconvenient. The speaker's intent is to humorously communicate their discomfort and dissatisfaction with the situation, and the use of sarcasm and the hashtag "#not" further confirms this. The overall tone is negative due to their current unpleasant experience. There is an element of pretense in their statement, as the speaker feigns a desire to throw up to emphasize their displeasure, but this is a clear use of sarcasm rather than genuine pretense. The literal meaning is the opposite of what is implied, highlighting the sarcastic nature of the statement. The preliminary analysis aligns with this conclusion and does not need changes; the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"The ones that caught me by surprise were the ones I didn't expect #duh #redundantredundant"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the statement is obvious or self-evident since events or things that are surprising are naturally those that are unexpected. The use of hashtags like "#duh" and "#redundantredundant" suggests that the speaker sees the initial statement as unnecessarily reiterative.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that the statement being made is redundant and possibly trivial. They find humor or irony in articulating an obvious fact, as indicated by the use of sarcasm in the hashtags.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are aligned. They are both highlighting the redundancy and self-evidence of the statement.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

5. **Pretense**: There is no pretense; the speaker genuinely finds humor in stating the obvious and is not hiding their amusement.

"When you're in the doctors waiting room and hear a baby in the back screaming her lungs out is always a reassuring feeling #not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that hearing a baby scream in the doctor's office is actually not reassuring at all. By using the hashtag "#not," they sarcastically indicate that the situation is, in fact, uncomfortable or unsettling.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that hearing a baby screaming in the doctor's office is distressing or anxiety-inducing. Instead of finding comfort, they likely feel tense or uneasy when confronted with such noises.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think appear to align. Both suggest that the screaming baby creates an uncomfortable or unsettling feeling.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker uses sarcasm, indicated by "#not," to express their true opinion. They are not pretending to have a different attitude; rather, they openly communicate their discomfort through humor and sarcasm.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
### Summary of Preliminary Analysis:

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies that hearing a baby screaming is far from reassuring, despite their initial, misleading statement that it is a reassuring feeling. 
- **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that waiting in a doctor's office can be stressful and disruptive sounds, like a baby crying, are exaggeratedly described as reassuring, but the hashtag "#not" signals the opposite.
- **Intent**: The speaker uses sarcasm to express frustration or discomfort, aiming to communicate their true thoughts humorously. The speaker is likely a patient waiting in a doctor's office.
- **Polarity**: The tone is negative, as indicated by the distressing scenario and the sarcastic use of "#not."
- **Pretense**: The speaker pretends to have a positive attitude through their statement, but this pretense is clearly undermined by the sarcastic hashtag.
- **Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests reassurance from a screaming baby, but the implied meaning signifies discomfort and is masked by sarcasm, particularly highlighted through the hashtag "#not."

### Conclusion:

The statement is undoubtedly sarcastic. The use of sarcasm is explicitly signaled through the hashtag "#not," contradicting the positive sentiment implied in the statement. The preliminary analysis effectively captures the sarcastic tone, and there is no significant change needed. The difference between the literal and implied meaning is clear, as the speaker uses sarcasm to express their true negative outlook on the situation.

The statement is: "the ONLY time a crime becomes a federal crime"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker seems to imply that there is a specific or limited criteria under which a crime is classified as a federal crime, potentially suggesting that the general public or the mentioned accounts may hold misconceptions about this process.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears to have a specific understanding of the circumstances under which a crime is escalated to a federal level, possibly indicating they believe it to be less common or more clearly defined than is generally thought.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the implication and the speaker's thoughts seem consistent, both emphasizing a particular condition or understanding of federal crimes that they believe is factual or correct.

Finally, the speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude; instead, they seem straightforward in expressing their opinion or understanding of what constitutes a federal crime.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "the ONLY time a crime becomes a federal crime" implies that there is a specific and possibly strict criterion for a crime to be classified as a federal offense. The speaker suggests that there might be common misconceptions about what qualifies as a federal crime, indicating they believe the process is less arbitrary or more defined than others might think. The speaker's understanding of what makes a crime federal, and their implication that this situation is misunderstood by others, are aligned. The statement carries a straightforward tone without pretense, reflecting a stance that is likely intended to correct or inform the audience. The polarity of the statement does not suggest a strong positive or negative tone, but it does hint at a critical view towards others' understanding of the process. There is little difference between the literal and implied meanings, as both suggest specificity in the criteria for federal crimes.

Based on this analysis, the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker seems earnestly focused on conveying their understanding, without irony or mocking intent. The preliminary analysis accurately reflects this straightforwardness, and no significant changes are necessary.

The tweet reads: "Wow...lol||Need cash in your hands today? Go to http://t.co/Mn8psbZpFH||#workfromhome #not #wun #not #mca... http://t.co/2ST4Esm0xK".

- The speaker implies that the situation being presented in the tweet is somewhat humorous or not to be taken seriously, as indicated by the "Wow...lol" at the beginning.
- The speaker likely thinks the cash opportunity or work-from-home offer is not genuine or trustworthy. This is inferred from the sarcastic tone conveyed through the hashtags like "#not" and the dismissive "lol."
- Both what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks align in suggesting skepticism towards the offer; they are mocking the idea that it could solve anyone's immediate financial needs.

The speaker is pretending to maintain a casual or amused attitude towards the conversation but is arguably more skeptical and dismissive.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature** - The speaker implies that the cash-in-hand opportunity from the provided link is probably unreliable or deceptive, hence not worthy of serious consideration.

**Presuppositions** - The speaker assumes the audience is familiar with online cash or work-from-home scams, hence the need for skepticism.

**Intent of the speaker** - The speaker aims to discredit or mock the linked opportunity, suggesting that it is another fake or scam that doesn't offer legitimate work-from-home possibilities. The target audience is likely other skeptical or wary individuals online.

**Polarity** - The tone conveyed in the hashtags, specifically "#not," and the use of "lol," gives the statement a negative, sarcastic connotation.

**Pretense** - There is pretense in the speaker's expressed amusement since it's likely a facade to mask their cynicism about the work-from-home opportunity shared.

**Meaning** - The literal offer in the tweet suggests a feasible work-from-home opportunity that can yield quick cash, but the implied meaning from the speaker is that this is unlikely to be true and should be treated with ridicule.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the initial evaluation is largely accurate. The statement is indeed sarcastic, exploiting the literal message to express skepticism and mockery about the reliability and truthfulness of such opportunities.

"Spending the majority of my day in and out of the doctor has been awesome. #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that spending the majority of their day at the doctor's office was not enjoyable or pleasant; in fact, it was likely frustrating or tiresome.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks negatively about the situation. They likely found the experience to be inconvenient, time-consuming, and perhaps exhausting or stressful, as indicated by the sarcastic tone.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication of the statement and what the speaker thinks are aligned. The use of sarcasm highlights their dissatisfaction or displeasure with spending most of the day at the doctor.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm to express their true feelings, which is a form of feigned positivity. They are pretending to view the day as "awesome," when in reality, they feel the opposite. Thus, they are indeed pretending to have a certain (positive) attitude while actually feeling negatively.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker is using sarcasm to express dissatisfaction with spending the day at the doctor's office. The statement implies that the experience was unpleasant, and the speaker's intent is to convey frustration. Although the statement is phrased positively, the implication is negative. The speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude by saying the experience was "awesome" while actually feeling the opposite. 

In summary, the analysis correctly identifies the use of sarcasm in the statement. The speaker's true feelings of frustration and inconvenience are masked by a facade of enjoyment, using sarcasm to emphasize their displeasure. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

The speaker's tweet is: "#Seen #a #headline #about #a #doctor #that #starts #with #"Doctor #who..."? #Why #not #stick #your #head #in #the #toilet #and #pull #the..."

- The speaker implies that they have a negative reaction to headlines that start with "Doctor who...". By suggesting that someone should stick their head in a toilet, the speaker conveys strong disapproval or disdain for this type of headline.
- The speaker thinks that these types of headlines are perhaps cliched, unoriginal, or irritating, as indicated by the use of hyperbolic, contemptuous imagery (sticking a head in a toilet).
- Yes, what the speaker implies (disapproval) and what the speaker thinks (irritation or disdain) are aligned. Both convey dislike for the format or frequency of such headlines.
- The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their statement seems straightforward and expressive of genuine frustration or annoyance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's tweet suggests a strong dislike for headlines that begin with "Doctor who...". The suggestion to stick one's head in the toilet is hyperbolic and conveys a high level of disdain for what the speaker perceives to be a cliched or unoriginal headline format. The intent appears to be to express irritation and contempt for these kinds of headlines to a broad audience on Twitter.

The implicature is that headlines starting with "Doctor who..." are considered by the speaker to be negative or annoying. The presupposition is that such headlines are common enough to have caused the speaker's frustration. The speaker hopes to convey their disdain and perhaps find solidarity with others who share this frustration.

The speaker's tone is negative, and there is no indication of pretense in their attitude; the irritation seems genuine. The literal suggestion to stick one's head in a toilet is absurd, serving to emphasize the speaker's dissatisfaction. The implied meaning is that reading such headlines is so bothersome that one might as well do something unpleasant.

Upon reflection, it seems that the analysis requires no major changes, and the statement does exhibit characteristics of sarcasm. The exaggerated suggestion highlights the absurdity of the response compared to the irritation caused by the headlines, thus pointing towards sarcasm.

"Love the fact that I turned off my alarm this morning and slept till so freaking late #not"

- The speaker implies that they are actually not happy about turning off their alarm and sleeping in late.
- The speaker thinks that sleeping in late was not a productive or desired outcome for their morning, as evidenced by the sarcastic "love" and the hashtag "#not."
- What the speaker implies aligns with what the speaker thinks; both suggest that they are dissatisfied with the situation. The use of sarcasm ("Love the fact") and the hashtag indicate that the speaker is expressing frustration or annoyance.
  
The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; instead, they are using sarcasm to convey their true feelings about oversleeping and missing the intended wake-up time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Love the fact that I turned off my alarm this morning and slept till so freaking late #not" is sarcastic. The implicature reveals that the speaker is not genuinely pleased with oversleeping, despite initially saying they "love" it. The presupposition is that the speaker had an alarm set for a reason, likely to wake up at a specific time, and turning it off led to an undesirable outcome. The intent of the speaker is to express frustration or annoyance about oversleeping, using sarcasm to convey dissatisfaction. 

The polarity is negative, as indicated by the phrase "so freaking late" and the hashtag "#not," which negates the positive tone of "love." There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; instead, the sarcasm directly conveys their true feelings. The literal meaning of the statement would suggest enjoyment in sleeping late, but the sarcastic tone and context imply the opposite.

Given the analysis, the preliminary characterization of the statement as sarcastic is accurate and aligns with the speaker's intent and underlying meaning. No changes are needed to the preliminary analysis.

"This team would finish fourth. #Irony #Arsenal #Afc"

- The speaker implies that there is an ironic situation regarding the team's performance, likely suggesting that finishing fourth may be unexpected or contrary to what might be expected of Arsenal.
- The speaker seems to think that Arsenal's performance does not match the expectation of a fourth-place finish, indicating surprise or disbelief.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are consistent. Both indicate a sense of irony related to the team's performance and expectations.
- It does not appear that the speaker is pretending; rather, they seem to genuinely find humor or irony in the situation concerning Arsenal's position.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement implies that there is an ironic twist to Arsenal finishing fourth, suggesting that such a standing may be unexpected or contrary to typical expectations. The speaker takes for granted the shared understanding among the audience that Arsenal either routinely finishes fourth or their current performance does not align with that expectation. The intent is to highlight this irony with a sense of humor, possibly poking fun at past patterns or defying typical expectations.

The polarity of the statement is negative, as the use of "irony" in this context is often linked with a critical or humorous undertone. There is no apparent pretense in the speaker's attitude; they seem genuinely amused by the situation. The literal meaning is that the team would finish fourth, but the implied meaning is that there's humor or surprise in the team achieving that position, suggesting a deviation from what might be typically presumed.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it might need clarification on the shared knowledge about the team's performance history, which is essential for fully grasping the irony. The statement is sarcastic because it highlights a discrepancy between expectation and reality in an amusing way, underscoring the irony rather than a genuine expectation of finishing fourth.

The statement "If you're going to give someone a scathing, 1-Star review for poor grammar, FFS use proper grammar" highlights the irony in criticizing someone for poor grammar while making grammatical errors oneself. The speaker implies hypocrisy and a lack of self-awareness by the reviewer. The intent is to expose and possibly ridicule the inconsistency and hypocrisy of the critic. The tone is negative, as it critiques the reviewer for their oversight. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they truly find the situation ironic and aim to call it out directly. The literal meaning is a direct admonishment for using poor grammar, while the implied meaning critiques the inconsistency and irony of the reviewer’s actions. Given this, the statement is indeed sarcastic, as it uses irony to highlight and ridicule the hypocrisy. The preliminary analysis aligns with this conclusion and requires no changes.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that getting sick is never convenient, and in this particular instance, it is especially inconvenient.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is expressing frustration or disappointment about being sick and likely finds it very untimely. The addition of the sad emoji emphasizes their displeasure.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts convey their dissatisfaction and annoyance with the timing of falling ill.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

The statement "Perfect time to get sick 😢 #not" demonstrates sarcasm as the speaker implies that there is never a good time to fall ill, and in this case, it is especially inconvenient. The addition of the hashtag "#not" and the sad emoji suggest the speaker is voicing their displeasure and frustration with getting sick at this time. The tone is negative, there is no pretense in the speaker's attitude, and the literal meaning (that it is a perfect time to get sick) contrasts strongly with the implied meaning (that it is an especially bad time to be sick). 

**Analysis Evaluation:**

- **Implicature:** The implied meaning is that it is an inconvenient time to be sick.
- **Presuppositions:** It is understood that being sick is usually undesirable.
- **Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker, possibly a person who has fallen ill, aims to express frustration and perhaps seek empathy from their audience.
- **Polarity:** The tone is negative, highlighting frustration.
- **Pretense:** There is no pretense; the speaker's attitude is clear.
- **Meaning Difference:** The literal message and implied meaning are opposites, reinforcing the sarcastic nature.

**Decision Based on Analysis:**

The statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker does not genuinely believe it's a "perfect time" to get sick, rather the complete opposite, which they express through sarcasm and the accompanying sad emoji.

"Pretty Shitty day I'm gonna be soaked and full of mud and clay #iliketogetdirty #notreally #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are having an unpleasant day, likely due to circumstances that will result in them becoming dirty and wet. Their use of hashtags suggests a sarcastic tone, indicating that they are not happy about getting dirty, despite initially stating that they "like to get dirty."

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is clearly not pleased about the prospect of being soaked and covered in mud and clay. The choice of words "Pretty Shitty day" conveys their dissatisfaction and frustration with the situation.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think are consistent. They imply and outright express that the day and the situation are undesirable and unpleasant to them.

Finally, is the speaker pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation?
Yes, the speaker is pretending to have a nonchalant or amused attitude toward the situation through the use of sarcasm and hashtags. However, it's clear from their statement that this attitude is not genuine, as they do not actually enjoy getting dirty.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis explains that the speaker implies they are having a negative day and are anticipating getting dirty, which they are not pleased about. The statement, along with the hashtags, signals sarcasm because the speaker pretends to be okay with getting dirty, but in reality, they are unhappy. 

1. **Implicature:** The speaker implies that getting dirty is undesirable, contrary to the #iliketogetdirty tag.
2. **Presuppositions:** The situation causing them to get dirty is unpleasant and unavoidable.
3. **Intent:** The speaker intends to humorously express dissatisfaction with their day while engaging their audience by using sarcasm.
4. **Polarity:** The tone of the last sentence has a negative connotation as indicated by "Pretty Shitty day."
5. **Pretense:** Yes, the speaker pretends to embrace the situation but the hashtag #notreally clarifies their true feelings.
6. **Meaning:** The literal meaning is that the speaker enjoys getting dirty, but the implied meaning is the opposite.

Based on the preliminary analysis, the statement is characterized as sarcastic because the speaker ostensibly states enjoyment about the situation, but the use of "Pretty Shitty day" and the hashtags #notreally and #sarcasm reveal their true dissatisfaction. The analysis accurately captures this sarcasm, and no changes to the interpretation are needed.

The statement made in the tweet is: "I love it when people try to tell me that Oakland is so much easier than other schools 😡 #not".

- The speaker implies that they are frustrated or annoyed when people claim that Oakland is easier compared to other schools. The inclusion of the angry emoji 😡 and the hashtag #not suggests sarcasm and contradiction.
- The speaker likely believes that Oakland is not easier than other schools and may even feel that it is being unfairly judged or underestimated.
- Yes, what the speaker implies (frustration with the misconception) and what they think (that Oakland is not easier) are aligned in conveying the same message.
- The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; their frustration and sarcasm clearly indicate their true stance on the matter.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The tweet seems to imply frustration with people who claim that attending Oakland is an easier experience compared to other schools. The speaker uses sarcasm, suggested by the angry emoji and the hashtag "#not," to express disagreement with this perception. The presupposition in the statement is that there is a common belief or argument that Oakland is easier, which the speaker disagrees with. The speaker aims to challenge this view and possibly defend the reputation or difficulty of Oakland. The last sentence carries a negative tone, conveyed through the emoji and phrasing. There's no pretense, as the speaker's sarcasm and annoyance are clearly expressed. The literal meaning of the statement is a supposed enjoyment of others' comments, but the implied meaning is one of frustration and opposition to those comments. 

Reflecting on this analysis, it's clear that the statement is heavily sarcastic as the speaker uses irony to convey their frustration and disbelief with the claims made about Oakland. The sarcasm is the speaker's method to emphasize their disagreement and assert that Oakland should not be underestimated.

The speaker's statement is: "Have you ever seen the like?? 'Republican move' that will 'effectively rob the royal family', Kate's 32k meal #irony http://t.co/BiGb5u44Eh"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a political move, referred to as a 'Republican move', that supposedly will disadvantage or 'rob' the royal family. The mention of Kate's 32k meal suggests absurdity or excessiveness to the situation.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to find the situation ironic, as indicated by the hashtag #irony. They are likely skeptical and incredulous about the scenario being described, especially the idea of a meal costing 32k in the context of the royal family being 'robbed'.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks appear to align. The speaker is acknowledging the absurdity or contradiction in the scenario by using #irony and expressing disbelief in the statement itself.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; instead, they appear genuinely incredulous or critical of the scenario they are referencing. They use language and a hashtag that convey skepticism or disbelief straightforwardly and consistently.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To determine whether the statement is sarcastic, we can analyze the elements provided:

1. **The Implicature**: The statement suggests that there is a contradiction between a political move purportedly affecting the royal family and the expensive nature of Kate's meal. The use of "#irony" implies that the speaker finds the situation ludicrous or contradictory.

2. **The Presuppositions**: The speaker assumes the audience is aware of the Royal Family's wealth and societal status and understands that a political move targeting them would typically not have significant financial impact. The mention of a 32k meal implies extravagance.

3. **The Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker seems to aim at highlighting the perceived absurdity or contradiction in the situation. The speaker appears to be mocking or criticizing the notion of a political move that would "rob" the royal family while they are depicted as enjoying lavish luxuries.

4. **The Polarity**: The tone in the final part of the statement is negative, as it questions the logic behind the situation and points out the contradiction with an ironic tag.

5. **Pretense**: There is no significant pretense in the speaker's attitude. Their skepticism and disbelief are openly conveyed.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning highlights a costly meal and a Republican move affecting the Royals. The implied meaning is mocking this scenario, emphasizing its irony and potential absurdity given the royal family's wealth.

Reflection on the Preliminary Analysis:
The analysis correctly outlines the irony perceived by the speaker. It notes the contradiction between the Royal Family being "robbed" and their extravagant expenses, suggesting disbelief or satire.

**Decision**: The statement is sarcastic. The speaker's use of "#irony" and the context of a 32k meal in light of a supposed financial threat to the Royals indicates a sarcastic tone, as they ridicule the perceived disconnect between the scenario's implications and reality.

The tweet reads: "@BarryBlackNE I don't think the Hereditary Baronet wants to encourage a something-for-nothing culture :-$ #irony"

- The speaker implies that there is a situation where someone, a "Hereditary Baronet," might be seen as promoting or benefiting from a "something-for-nothing" culture, and finds it ironic given the title's association with privilege.
- The speaker appears to think that there is irony in the Hereditary Baronet's position or actions, suggesting a belief that their stance against a "something-for-nothing" culture might be hypocritical or inconsistent with their own status or actions.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are consistent: they are highlighting an irony between the Hereditary Baronet's likely stance and their own societal position.
- The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; the irony is a genuine observation about the situation from their perspective.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement implies irony in the Hereditary Baronet's stance on promoting a "something-for-nothing" culture, suggesting their opposition to such a culture contradicts their own privileged status. The presupposition is that a Hereditary Baronet, by nature of their inherited title, benefits from unearned prestige or privileges. The speaker, likely addressing Barry Black, aims to highlight perceived hypocrisy or irony in the Baronet's position.

The polarity of the last sentence, marked with "#irony," suggests a negative tone, as the speaker critiques the Hereditary Baronet's stance. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they genuinely perceive irony in the situation. The literal meaning is a straightforward statement, but the implied meaning suggests a critique of hypocrisy.

To summarize, the speaker finds an inconsistency between the Hereditary Baronet's likely views and their social status, using irony to underscore this critique. The statement is sarcastic, as it uses the mention of "irony" and the Hereditary Baronet's title to point out perceived hypocrisy.

The tweeted statement says: "@KalobTaulien @twitter Yes on Auto-messagers No to #FollowBackers ... They make me money over on TSU. Thx your post||http://t.co/ALSThKb1pG"

- The speaker implies that they support the use of auto-messagers (possibly automated responses or messages) and are against the use of follow-back strategies. They also imply that these strategies have been beneficial for them financially on the platform TSU.
- The speaker seems to think that automated messaging is a useful tool for generating income, while follow-back strategies are not beneficial or desirable in their experience.
- What the speaker implies and what they think are indeed saying the same thing: they have had a positive financial experience using auto-messagers over follow-back strategies, particularly on TSU.

The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. They clearly state their preference and provide a reason for it, mentioning a direct benefit (making money on TSU).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In the analysis of the tweet, let's break down the elements:

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies they favor auto-messagers as they claim these have been financially beneficial for them on TSU, while they dismiss follow-back strategies.

- **Presuppositions**: The statement takes for granted that the audience is familiar with terms like auto-messagers, follow-back strategies, and TSU. It also assumes that the audience understands these are social media or digital marketing strategies.

- **Intent of the speaker**: The speaker likely aims to share their personal experience and opinion on these marketing strategies, perhaps to influence others to try auto-messagers or to validate their choice to those already using similar approaches. The speaker may also intend to thank the specific individuals tagged for their post which seems related to this discussion.

- **Polarity**: The expression of thanks at the end and stating they make money contributes an overall positive tone to the message.

- **Pretense**: There does not appear to be any pretense in the speaker's attitude; they straightforwardly express their opinion and the benefits they've experienced.

- **Meaning**: There's little difference between the literal and implied meaning; both suggest that auto-messagers are financially beneficial for the speaker, whereas follow-back strategies are not.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, nothing suggests sarcasm. The speaker appears genuine in their endorsement of auto-messagers and disapproval of follow-back strategies due to perceived financial gains. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

**The Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker intends to express discontent with having to work all weekend while also acknowledging the financial aspect as a positive. They are likely trying to connect with their audience by injecting humor into a relatable situation.

The speaker states: "@folieadang aha, but white girl drinks make me 'so so cray tipsy'".

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that consuming drinks typically associated with "white girls" affects them significantly, making them feel very tipsy or intoxicated.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely approaches the situation with humor, playfully acknowledging that these drinks have a pronounced effect on their intoxication level. They may also be commenting on the stereotype of "white girl drinks," suggesting these beverages are seen as being less potent but still affecting them strongly.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they are both addressing the unexpectedly strong effect of these drinks on the speaker, with a humorous undertone.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker might be adopting a playful or humorous tone rather than seriously discussing the strength of the drinks. They likely do not have a negative or judgmental view but are using humor to convey their experience.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement implies that the speaker finds "white girl drinks" surprisingly potent, leading to them feeling "so so cray tipsy" after consuming them. The presupposition here is that "white girl drinks" are typically considered less strong or perhaps stereotypically associated with a specific demographic's drinking habits. The intent of the speaker seems to be to make a humorous remark about their reaction to these drinks, potentially poking fun at the stereotype while acknowledging their own low tolerance or unexpected response.

The polarity of the speaker's statement appears positive as it is stated in a lighthearted and humorous manner. There is pretense in the speaker's attitude as they adopt a playful tone instead of seriously discussing the impact of the drinks.

The literal meaning of the statement is that the speaker becomes very tipsy from "white girl drinks," but the implied meaning is that the speaker is humorously highlighting the stereotype of these drinks being less potent while expressing surprise at their drunkenness.

Reflecting on this analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker is using humor to convey an exaggerated sense of tipsiness caused by drinks that are stereotypically perceived as mild, likely with the intent of making a playful contrast between expectation and reality.

The statement made in the tweet is: "tried to export an azure vm, well that went ok #sarcasm #vmcorrupt #thankyoumicrosoft #startalloveragain"

- The speaker implies that the attempt to export an Azure virtual machine did not go well, potentially resulting in a corrupted virtual machine, which is sarcastically appreciated with "thankyoumicrosoft", and they're forced to start the process over again.
- The speaker thinks that the situation is frustrating and probably feels disappointed or annoyed with Microsoft for the complication they've encountered during the export process.
- What the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are aligned, both expressing dissatisfaction and sarcasm towards the failed attempt and the inconvenience it has caused.
- The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude towards the conversation; the use of hashtags like #sarcasm clearly conveys their genuine frustration and sarcasm regarding the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

- **Implicature:** The speaker's statement implies that the export attempt did not go smoothly, resulting in a negative outcome such as data or process corruption. 

- **Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that the process of exporting an Azure virtual machine should work without errors, but it didn’t. It’s also presumed that Microsoft is responsible for the tool or process that led to frustration.

- **Intent of the speaker:** The speaker aims to express dissatisfaction and frustration with Microsoft’s Azure service. The speaker uses sarcasm to convey frustration about having to start the process again due to corruption. 

- **Polarity:** The tone is negative, focusing on the failure and inconvenience caused by the export attempt.

- **Pretense:** There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude. The statement is openly sarcastic, as denoted by the hashtag #sarcasm, indicating a lack of satisfaction and appreciation.

- **Meaning:** The literal meaning of saying "that went ok" contrasts with the implied meaning of sarcasm, suggesting the opposite—that the attempt was not successful and the situation is frustrating.

Reflecting on the analysis, it successfully captures the speaker’s sarcastic intent. The hashtags reinforce the sarcasm, and the use of language clearly indicates dissatisfaction. Thus, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"#TGIF oh just kidding I have 30 mins from one job to the next. love 12 hour days. #serverlife #sarcasm #nolife"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they don't actually get to enjoy the benefits or relief usually associated with "Thank God It's Friday," as they are too busy working multiple jobs with only a short break in between. They imply a sense of exhaustion and a lack of work-life balance.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is evidently frustrated with their situation. They are tired from working long hours and feel that their life lacks the free time typically enjoyed by others who might have more traditional schedules.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the implication and their thoughts are aligned. Both suggest dissatisfaction with having to work long hours without a real break to enjoy their time off.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm to express their true feelings. They are not genuinely expressing love for 12-hour workdays or a schedule that leaves them no personal time, rather, they are highlighting their unhappiness. Therefore, the speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude by using sarcasm to emphasize the opposite effect.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement implies that the speaker does not get to enjoy the typical relief associated with Friday ("TGIF") due to their demanding work schedule. The presupposition is that Fridays are usually associated with leisure or the end of the work week, which the speaker is clearly not experiencing. 

The speaker aims to express frustration and dissatisfaction about their long work hours, having only a 30-minute break between shifts, and not being able to revel in what Friday typically represents. The tone is negative, and the speaker does not genuinely love 12-hour days, which are ironically acknowledged in the hashtags, including "#sarcasm."

There is a clear pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they sarcastically express a love for their exhausting schedule to underscore their actual displeasure. The literal meaning of the statement is that the speaker loves 12-hour workdays, but the implied meaning is that they feel overworked and lacking personal time, contrary to their sarcastic expression.

The preliminary analysis correctly identifies that the speaker is using sarcasm to convey their true feelings about their demanding work life. There is alignment between the implied and expressed thoughts, reinforcing the sarcastic nature of the statement. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

The polarity of the statement is negative, given the expression of sadness. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude as it appears to be direct and honest. The literal and implied meanings align, as both indicate the speaker's significant sadness.

Upon reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it appears accurate in concluding that the statement is not sarcastic.

The statement is: "Gavy is one rude motherfucker. *Subtweets me* *Calls me a motherfucker* #Irony"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that the person named Gavy has accused the speaker of being rude by using a subtweet and explicitly calling them a "motherfucker." This is seen as ironic because the speaker considers Gavy's actions to be rude themselves.
  
- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker thinks that Gavy's behavior is hypocritical. They find it ironic that Gavy is calling them rude while simultaneously engaging in rude behavior by subtweeting and using offensive language.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

Finally, the speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. They seem genuinely frustrated and are straightforwardly calling out what they perceive as irony in Gavy's actions.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Analysis:**

- **Implicature:** The claim here is that Gavy accuses the speaker of being offensive while performing offensive acts himself. The term "irony" suggests that the speaker finds Gavy's behavior contradictory.

- **Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that subtweeting and calling someone a "motherfucker" are inherently rude behaviors, and therefore Gavy's behavior is ironic because he engages in those actions while accusing others of rudeness.

- **Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker aims to highlight perceived hypocrisy in Gavy's actions and expose the irony. The speaker uses mockery to emphasize their point.

- **Polarity:** The tone is negative, as the speaker describes Gavy in offensive terms and criticizes his behavior.

- **Pretense:** There is no pretense—the speaker is bluntly expressing their disdain for Gavy's actions.

- **Meaning:** While the literal meaning points out Gavy's actions, the implied meaning criticizes the double standards of Gavy's behavior.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement highlights a contradiction between Gavy's accusations and his actions, labeling them as ironic. The speaker is genuinely frustrated with what they perceive as hypocrisy. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic, as it uses irony to criticize Gavy's behavior.

The statement is: "Yeah, you're a grown up & at times feel very nostalgic towards your Bachpan. Life's handiwork!!"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that it is a common and perhaps natural experience for adults to feel nostalgia for their childhood (referred to as "Bachpan"). This nostalgia is something that happens as a result of the way life unfolds.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to view this feeling of nostalgia as an inevitable part of adulthood. They suggest that it is an aspect of "life's handiwork," implying that it is a crafted or designed aspect of life, with some level of acceptance if not appreciation for it.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they align. The speaker implies and thinks that nostalgia for childhood is a normal part of being an adult, something designed by life's progression.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending. They seem to genuinely acknowledge and accept that nostalgia is a part of adult life, expressing it as an inherent and crafted outcome of life's journey.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement under analysis suggests a natural tendency for adults to feel nostalgic about their childhood, which is described as "life's handiwork." The analysis indicates that the speaker implies this nostalgia is a common, inevitable aspect of adulthood, essentially crafted by the nature of life itself. The speaker aligns their thoughts with this implication, regarding the feeling as an inherent part of adult life without any pretense in their tone.

Now, let's evaluate if sarcasm is present in the statement:

1. Implicature: The speaker implies that nostalgia is a consequence of adulthood, framed as a natural part of life's outcomes.

2. Presuppositions: It is taken for granted that everyone experiences nostalgia for their childhood.

3. Intent of the Speaker: The intent seems to be an acknowledgment or acceptance of the pattern of nostalgia that comes with adulthood. The speaker appears to be reflecting on life's process rather than criticizing it.

4. Polarity: The tone of the statement is neutral to slightly positive, given that the speaker refers to life creating this feeling as "handiwork," indicating a crafted, deliberate outcome.

5. Pretense: There does not appear to be pretense in the speaker's attitude. The statement seems genuine in its acceptance of nostalgia as part of adulthood.

6. Meaning: The literal meaning conveys adults feeling nostalgic for their childhood, while the implied meaning is that this is an expected, pre-designed aspect of life.

Based on this analysis, the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker expresses a sincere acknowledgment of nostalgia as a natural and accepted part of grown-up life, without irony or mockery. Therefore, the preliminary analysis should remain unchanged in concluding the statement's sincerity.

The statement is: "I mean Zach is a teacher, amirite?"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is something about Zach being a teacher that is relevant or noteworthy in the context of the conversation. The use of "amirite?" suggests that the speaker believes this point is obvious or universally agreed upon and is looking for affirmation from others.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to think that Zach's status as a teacher is an obvious fact that should resonate with the audience or serve as an explanation or justification within the conversation.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the thought expressed are consistent; they suggest that Zach being a teacher is a significant or explanatory detail in the context of the conversation.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
There is not enough information to suggest that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude. The speaker appears to genuinely believe that Zach being a teacher is relevant or important, and is seeking agreement from others. The phrase "amirite?" is casual and conversational, potentially indicating a relaxed and open stance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
### Summary of Preliminary Analysis

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that Zach's status as a teacher is relevant or illustrative in the context of the conversation. It suggests that this information is either common knowledge or should be understood by the audience as significant.

2. **Presuppositions**: The statement presupposes that the audience knows Zach and understands either the stereotype or characteristic traits associated with being a teacher, which are relevant in this context.

3. **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker seems to aim for consensus on an implied point about teachers or Zach's identity as a teacher. The phrase "amirite?" implies that the speaker expects others to agree with the statement.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the statement derived from "amirite?" is relaxed and possibly positive, aiming for agreement or shared amusement.

5. **Pretense**: There is no overt indication of pretense. The speaker appears to sincerely highlight Zach's occupation as noteworthy in the discussion.

6. **Meaning**: The speaker's literal statement is straightforward. However, the implied meaning suggests there is a broader, potentially humorous or stereotypical, commentary being made about teachers or Zach specifically that the speaker believes is self-evident.

**Reflection**: The analysis suggests a straightforward interpretation without sarcasm. The speaker does not appear to negate their literal words with a deeper or hidden contradictory meaning, which is typically the core of sarcasm. The conversational style and inquiry for affirmation ("amirite?") indicates a genuine attempt at confirming a shared understanding or perception.

### Conclusion
The statement is not sarcastic. The literal and implied meanings align without contradiction, and pretense seems absent. The speaker's intention appears to be an earnest effort to highlight Zach's occupation as a teacher, assuming it holds a particular significance within the conversation's context.

The speaker appears to support this initiative, showing enthusiasm for increasing conservative presence while focusing on the financial benefits. The preliminary analysis concludes that the speaker is genuine in their appeal and not pretending to have a different attitude.

Analyzing the key factors for sarcasm:
- **Implicature**: The speaker implies a straightforward need for conservative users and highlights financial incentives, suggesting a genuine promotional effort.

The statement is: "Also it is funny how things at work get done when I'm on my off week #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that work processes or tasks are not typically accomplished efficiently or effectively when they are present. However, when they're on their week off, suddenly things begin to get done, suggesting that perhaps their presence might hinder productivity, or that the team uses their absence as an opportunity to catch up on work.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems frustrated or amused, in a sarcastic way, about how the completion of tasks aligns with their absence. They likely feel that there is an inconsistency in how work is managed while they're around versus when they're not.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they both indicate frustration with the perceived inefficiency or reliance on their absence for work to be completed. The sarcasm highlights an expectation of inefficiency during their presence, whereas their absence contrasts with unexpected productivity.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The use of sarcasm suggests that the speaker is not literally amused but is instead expressing irritation or disappointment. The "funny" aspect is not genuinely humorous but is instead intended to highlight the absurdity or frustration with the work situation. The speaker is not so much pretending but rather employing sarcasm to convey their true feelings indirectly.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Also it is funny how things at work get done when I'm on my off week #sarcasm" implies that tasks or projects at the speaker's workplace only seem to be completed when they are not present. The speaker presupposes that there is an unusual discrepancy in work productivity depending on their presence. They hope to express irritation or disappointment, masked by a sarcastic remark, directed at their workplace dynamics, possibly indicating that they feel unappreciated or that their presence somehow correlates with inefficiency.

The polarity of the statement is negative, despite using the word "funny," as it is sarcastically lamenting the inconsistency in productivity. There is an element of pretense, as the speaker claims something is "funny" while actually being dissatisfied.

The literal meaning suggests something amusing, while the implied meaning expresses the speaker's dissatisfaction or frustration. The hashtag "#sarcasm" makes intentional the sarcastic tone, eliminating ambiguity about the genuine sentiment behind the statement.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the imperative to change anything is minimal. The tone and intention are well-identified: it is indeed sarcastic, accentuating dissatisfaction with workplace dynamics in a seemingly humorous manner. Therefore, the statement is sarcastic.

"Go you! #not Home until the 1st Jan. So excited!"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they are going to be away from home until January 1st and are excited about whatever is keeping them away from home during this time. The use of "#not" suggests a play on the phrase commonly used to negate the preceding statement, but in this context seems to mean they are literally not going home.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to be genuinely enthusiastic and happy about the fact that they will not be home until January 1st. Their excitement suggests that they are looking forward to the time away or the events leading up to that date.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implied meaning and the speaker's explicit statement align in that they are conveying excitement and anticipation for being away from home until the specified date.

The speaker doesn't seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; their excitement appears to be authentic based on the language used in the tweet.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis interprets the statement as genuinely enthusiastic, suggesting the speaker is excited about not being home until January 1st. The use of "#not" is considered as a literal statement, meaning the speaker is not going home, and the closing "So excited!" is taken at face value to convey true excitement. 

However, upon deeper analysis:

1. **Implicature**: The presence of "#not" typically introduces sarcasm, casting doubt on the genuine excitement about not being home. The speaker might imply they are not happy about being away from home.

2. **Presuppositions**: It presupposes that being "not home" could traditionally be negative, contrasting with usual excitement, leading the reader to question the authenticity of the excitement.

3. **Intent**: The speaker likely aims to convey dissatisfaction or frustration about not being home, using sarcasm to express that sentiment. The audience consists of followers or friends on Twitter who understand the context.

4. **Polarity**: While "So excited!" appears positive, it contrasts with the negativity of being away during holiday time, often considered family time.

5. **Pretense**: The excitement is likely a pretense, as the element of sarcasm is suggested by the hashtag "#not".

6. **Meaning**: The literal statement suggests excitement, while the implied meaning, considering the common usage of "#not" for sarcasm, suggests discontent.

Reflecting on these points, the preliminary analysis should have recognized the sarcastic tone, evident in the choice of hashtag and the contextually contradictory exclamation of excitement. Therefore, the statement is sarcastic.

3. **Intent**: The speaker aims to highlight this oversight with sarcasm, expressing frustration or disbelief. The use of sarcasm suggests that they find the situation absurd or disappointing.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the statement is negative, conveying discontent or disapproval.

5. **Pretense**: There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude. Sarcasm is used explicitly to convey their true feelings about the situation.

### Reflection and Decision:

The song was 'don't cry for me Argentina' #irony

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a discrepancy between the situation and the meaning or theme of the song "Don't Cry for Me Argentina."

- The Implicature: The speaker implies that there is a humorous or contradictory aspect to playing the song in the current situation, as it seems mismatched with the song's message.

- The intent of the speaker: The speaker aims to highlight the ironic nature of the situation and perhaps amuse others by pointing it out.
- The polarity: The tone of the statement is neutral to positive, as it highlights irony in a somewhat lighthearted way.
- Pretense: There doesn't appear to be any pretense. The speaker genuinely points out the irony without any underlying attitude of pretending.
- Meaning: The literal meaning states that the song played was "Don't Cry for Me Argentina," whereas the implied meaning communicates the irony of the situation due to the mismatch between the song's message and the context.

Considering this analysis, the statement is sarcastic. The use of "#irony" emphasizes the humorous contradiction between the song's meaning and the context, suggesting the speaker finds the situation amusingly incongruous. The analysis aligns well with the conclusion of sarcasm.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker might be employing a light-hearted or humorous tone, as indicated by the hashtag "#whatamidoing," which could suggest a feigned confusion or jest about their ambition. This hints that while they genuinely find value in the proposition, they might not be entirely serious or are adding a layer of humor to their request.

The speaker's stated desire for shared influence aligns with their belief in the benefits offered by such influence. There is a light-hearted or humorous tone suggested by the hashtag "#whatamidoing," indicating that while the speaker finds value in the idea, they might not be entirely serious, employing humor or jest.

Sarcasm Analysis:
1. Implicature: The speaker implies they want to share in someone's power or influence.
2. Presuppositions: It is assumed someone has significant control ("world on a string") and that sharing this can yield benefits.
3. Intent: The speaker hopes to achieve a humorous or light-hearted acknowledgment of their desire for influence.
4. Polarity: Positive, with a humorous undertone.
5. Pretense: There is pretense in the attitude, as indicated by the hashtag, suggesting humor or jest.
6. Meaning: The literal meaning is asking for influence to use in "cool applications," but the implied meaning suggests humor in the request.

The speaker is not seriously asking for such power but is instead highlighting the absurdity of the situation in a joking manner. The statement is sarcastic.

The tweet states: "Isn't this blaming the victim? #sarcasm RT @chronicle Every year, 600K college students are injured while drunk. http://t.co/guuGP49ZZD"

- The speaker implies that by pointing out the number of college students injured while drunk, there is a suggestion that the students are responsible for their own injuries because of their drunken state.
- The speaker seems to believe that the responsibility should not solely fall on the students, indicating skepticism or criticism about blaming victims for their own misfortunes.
- The use of sarcasm suggests that what the speaker implies (that blaming the students is inappropriate) and what the speaker thinks (that the statistic is perhaps being used to unjustly place blame) are aligned, but expressed through irony.

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude but rather using sarcasm to highlight what they perceive as misguided blame being placed on victims within the context of the discussion.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis of the tweet considers the implied message, presupposed beliefs, speaker's intent, polarity, pretense, and meaning. Here's a summary:

- **Implicature:** The tweet suggests that highlighting statistics of injuries while drunk is akin to blaming the victims – the students.
- **Presuppositions:** It's taken for granted that highlighting these statistics suggests students are responsible for being injured due to drunkenness.
- **Speaker's Intent:** The speaker, employing sarcasm, aims to critique what they perceive as the unjust placement of blame on students for their drunken mishaps, thus defending the 'victims'.
- **Polarity:** The tone of the tweet is negative, as it critiques the notion of victim-blaming.
- **Pretense:** There is no pretense; sarcasm is used directly to make the speaker's point.
- **Meaning:** Literally, the tweet seems to ask if victim-blaming is occurring, while implied meaning criticizes the act of blaming injured students.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The use of "#sarcasm" and the rhetorical questioning are clear indicators that the speaker is critiquing the underlying assumption that students are at fault for their own injuries due to alcohol consumption. The analysis accurately captures the irony and critical viewpoint expressed in the tweet. The statement is not simply reporting statistics but rather questioning the framing of those statistics in a way that appears to blame victims, reinforcing the sarcastic nature.

The speaker said: "@pembertonx just lost a fiver already on the early kick off, cheers Forrest :)"

- The speaker implies that they placed a bet or a wager on the early kick-off game and lost five pounds. This loss is attributed to the outcome of the game involving the team Forrest.
- The speaker seems to express mild frustration or disappointment about losing the money so early, but the use of the ':)' suggests they might be taking the loss in stride or attempting to appear light-hearted about it.
- What the speaker implies (that they lost money on a game) and what they think (their sentiment about this loss) are quite aligned. However, their actual feelings might be more disappointed than they are letting on.
- The speaker might be pretending to have a light-hearted or humorous attitude about losing the money, indicated by the smiley face, suggesting an attempt to downplay their annoyance or frustration.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement expresses a loss of five pounds due to a bet on the early kick-off game, with the team Forrest potentially affecting the outcome. The smiley face can imply an attempt to be light-hearted despite the disappointment, masking true feelings of frustration. The implicature is that the speaker bet on Forrest, and their loss implies Forrest did not perform as expected. They presuppose that the audience understands sports betting and the specific context of Forrest's involvement. The intent might be to share the experience humorously with followers, possibly hoping for sympathy or commiseration. The polarity of the final sentiment hints at negativity wrapped in a veil of humor. The pretense lies in their effort to appear unbothered by the loss, creating a humorous tone.

Reflecting on this analysis, the statement contains sarcasm. The use of "cheers Forrest :)" suggests sarcasm, as it juxtaposes a positive, grateful remark with the reality of financial loss due to Forrest's performance, signifying an attempt to downplay actual negative emotions through humor. The smiley face reinforces this sarcastic tension between the genuine frustration of losing money and the mock acceptance of the situation.

In analyzing the statement, "Someone tell me where tf to find a fried chicken ornament bc this shit is necessary," the speaker is implying a humorous or whimsical urgency in locating a fried chicken ornament, suggesting it's essential for reasons unstated but likely light-hearted or funny. The speaker presupposes that the audience understands this context and shares a similar sense of humor or amusement.

The tweet states: "@holyroodmandy @jimmurphymp @scottishlabour problem solved no more reading out at FMQ what someone at WM wrote #irony."

- The speaker implies that there was an issue with reading out statements or speeches at First Minister's Questions (FMQ) that were written by someone at Westminster (WM), and now this issue is resolved.
- The speaker seems to think the situation is ironic, suggesting they may find it ridiculous or humorous that this problem ever existed in the first place. The use of the hashtag "#irony" implies that the situation has an ironic twist.
- The implication of the situation being "solved" aligns with the speaker's ironic tone, indicating they might not truly believe it's a genuine solution, or they find the resolution amusing due to its circumstances. Overall, what the speaker implies and what they seem to think are saying the same thing: there's irony in the situation supposedly being resolved.

The speaker is likely adopting a sarcastic or mocking tone given their use of the term "irony" and the context of the statement, suggesting they may not genuinely believe the problem is perfectly resolved or are critical of how it was previously handled.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The tweet reveals an ironic sentiment about the issue of reading out statements at the First Minister's Questions (FMQ), which are written by someone at Westminster (WM). The speaker uses the hashtag "#irony" to suggest that the situation is humorously or ridiculously portrayed as being "solved," even though the underlying problem might not truly be resolved to their satisfaction or might seem trivial to them.

- **Implicature:** The implication is that solving the problem has a humorous or absurd aspect, given the use of "#irony."
- **Presuppositions:** It presupposes there was a notable problem with reading out WM-prepared statements at FMQ, and this was recognized as an issue by the audience.
- **Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker appears to be mocking or critiquing the situation by highlighting its irony, likely addressing a political audience familiar with FMQ and WM dynamics.
- **Polarity:** The tone of the last sentence, especially due to the "#irony," is negative, suggesting skepticism or disbelief in the resolution's effectiveness or necessity.
- **Pretense:** The speaker adopts a pretense of agreement with the problem's resolution, but their real intention is to mock or highlight what they perceive as the absurdity or triviality of calling it "solved."
- **Meaning:** The literal statement suggests a straightforward problem resolution, but the implied meaning and tone indicate skepticism or criticism, underscored by the irony highlighted.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it consistently portrays sarcasm. The statement is sarcastic because the speaker's tone, choice of language, and use of irony indicate they are mocking the idea that the problem is genuinely solved or was even significant.

The speaker is saying, "Because #LOGICALLY, that does #NOT #fully #compute. If they wear #LESS #PROTECTION for a "#DEADLY #VIRUS" & do #NOT "#get" #EBOLA as result?"

- The speaker implies skepticism or confusion about a perceived inconsistency in the level of protective measures against a deadly virus like Ebola and the outcome of not getting the virus despite reduced protection.
- The speaker seems to think that the situation does not make logical sense, as it defies their expectations of how exposure to a deadly virus should work.
- The implication of the statement and the speaker's personal belief seem aligned, both expressing doubt and questioning the rationale behind the situation.
- The speaker is not pretending to have their attitude; their genuine confusion and disbelief about a health-related scenario are evident in the tone and phrasing of their tweet.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
### Preliminary Analysis Summary:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker suggests that there is an inconsistency between the level of protection worn and the expected outcomes regarding exposure to a deadly virus like Ebola. They imply disbelief that reduced protection could still prevent infection.

2. **Presuppositions**: The speaker presupposes that higher protection leads to a lower chance of contracting a deadly virus and that any deviation from this expectation needs logical explanation.

3. **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker is questioning and criticizing the logic or perceived decision-making related to virus protection. They aim to highlight what they see as an irrational or confusing situation, likely addressing authorities or decision-makers in health.

4. **Polarity**: The tone is negative due to the skepticism and doubt expressed towards the situation.

5. **Pretense**: There is no pretense; the speaker's confusion and disbelief appear genuine.

6. **Literal vs. Implied Meaning**: Literally, the speaker mentions the level of protection against a deadly virus and the outcome. Implied, they doubt the adequacy of the protective measures and question their effectiveness.

### Conclusion:

The statement is sarcastic. The use of capitalized hashtags and the phrase "LOGICALLY" combined with "does NOT fully compute" reflects sarcasm, as the speaker is mocking or challenging the inconsistency they perceive, questioning the logical basis in a situation where the expected outcome (getting Ebola) does not align with actual results (not getting Ebola) despite reduced protection. The exaggerated tone and implied contradiction in expectations enhance the sarcastic nature.

The statement is: "Lesson learnt? Herd of sheep who fought over TVs on #BlackFriday struggling to sell them http://t.co/OMXl5ZPOdY #irony #capitalism"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that people who eagerly bought televisions during the Black Friday sales are now finding themselves in a difficult position as they attempt to sell them off, perhaps at a loss, which they find ironic.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to view the situation as ridiculous and emblematic of consumer culture gone awry, perhaps mocking those who scrambled to purchase the TVs by likening them to a 'herd of sheep.' This implies that they perceive the consumers' buying frenzy as lacking in foresight and overly driven by consumerist hype.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts convey skepticism and criticism towards the behavior of consumers during Black Friday, suggesting they acted blindly and unwisely.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending in their attitude. Their use of the phrase "herd of sheep" and the hashtags #irony #capitalism indicates a genuine critical stance towards consumer behavior and the societal pressures of capitalism.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement suggests that individuals who aggressively purchased TVs on Black Friday are now struggling to sell them, using terms like "herd of sheep" to imply thoughtless behavior. The implication is that these consumers acted without foresight, driven by consumerism rather than necessity or rational decision-making. The speaker sees this as emblematic of the absurdities within capitalist consumer culture and views it with skepticism and disapproval.

- The Implicature is that the behavior was driven by impulsiveness and lack of foresight.
- The Presuppositions are that the purchases were unnecessary and driven by hype.
- The speaker hopes to critique or mock consumer culture and those who fall prey to it.
- The polarity of the sentence is negative, as it criticizes the behavior of consumers.
- There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they appear to genuinely hold a critical view.

The literal meaning discusses people struggling to sell purchased TVs, but the implied meaning adds a layer of critique about consumer behavior. The analysis aligns with these points, suggesting no significant changes needed.

Based on this analysis, the statement is sarcastic. The speaker uses irony by juxtaposing the eagerness to buy with the subsequent struggle to sell, highlighting the absurdity of the situation, and mocking consumerist tendencies.

"Few #relations are by #chance, few are by #choice and few are by #Facebook!! #irony"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that relationships can form in various ways: some randomly by chance, others through deliberate choice, and some may stem from social media interactions, specifically on Facebook. The use of the hashtag #irony suggests a disconnect or conflict between expectations and reality when it comes to forming relationships via Facebook.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to find it amusing or ironic that relationships can be initiated on a platform like Facebook, which isn't traditionally meant for forming deep, substantive relationships, especially when compared to relationships started by chance or choice, which carry a more natural or intentional connotation.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. Both aspects highlight a humorous or ironic view of relationships being formed on Facebook compared to other more conventional or seemingly sincere ways.

The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude. The tone suggests a genuine amusement or ironic observation regarding the role of social media in forming relationships.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

The statement "Few #relations are by #chance, few are by #choice and few are by #Facebook!! #irony" suggests that relationships can form through various means, though it specifically draws attention to the role of Facebook in this process, which is seen as ironic. The use of the hashtag #irony and the general tone reflect a humorous view on the expectation versus reality when it comes to forming relationships on a social media platform. The speaker finds it amusing that Facebook, not traditionally seen as a place for forming deep relationships, plays a similar role to chance and choice. Their attitude genuinely appears to be one of amusement, without pretense.

**Analysis for Sarcasm Determination:**

- **Implicature:** The statement implies that Facebook, a social media platform, has an unexpected or ironic role in forming relationships, which contrasts with the more natural or deliberate formation of relationships by chance or choice.

- **Presuppositions:** The speaker presupposes that relationships formed by chance or choice are more traditional or meaningful compared to those formed via Facebook.

- **Intent:** The speaker intends to highlight the irony of modern relationship formations and might be targeting an audience familiar with social media culture.

- **Polarity:** The tone of the statement is positive, carrying a humorous and light-hearted intent rather than criticism.

- **Pretense:** There is no pretense; the speaker's attitude appears genuine in conveying amusement or irony.

- **Meaning:** Literally, it simply states three ways relationships can form, but the implied meaning points out the unexpected seriousness of relationships started on Facebook, contrasting it with traditional methods.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it appears accurate in identifying the statement as being ironic rather than sarcastic. The speaker does not express disdain or derision but rather a humorous observation, thus the statement is not sarcastic.

The statement is: "I am so glad that I woke up early for this office visit to have to the mother not show up! #not"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they are frustrated or annoyed about waking up early for an office visit, only for the person they were supposed to meet, presumably a mother, to not show up. The use of "#not" indicates sarcasm, highlighting their displeasure.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker is dissatisfied and possibly annoyed or irritated by the situation, as it appears to be a waste of their time and effort, given that they prepared for a meeting that did not take place as planned due to the absence of the mother.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, the speaker's implication of displeasure and their apparent frustration are consistent with each other. The use of sarcasm (#not) clearly conveys their dissatisfaction with the situation.

The speaker is using sarcasm to pretend to have a positive attitude toward the conversation, but their true feelings of annoyance are evident through the context and use of the hashtag "#not."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

The speaker's statement suggests frustration or annoyance due to waking up early for an office visit where the expected person, a mother, did not show up. The hashtag "#not" indicates sarcasm, as it implies the opposite of being "so glad." The speaker presupposes that an appointment was planned and expected. Their intent is to express displeasure about the wasted effort. The tone of the last sentence is negative, and there is pretense in expressing a seemingly positive sentiment. The literal meaning of being glad contradicts the implied negative feeling, revealing sarcasm.

**Decision:**

The statement is sarcastic. The speaker's use of "#not" clarifies that they express frustration rather than genuine gladness. The analysis accurately reflects the sarcasm, intending to highlight the irony of being glad when the actual sentiment is the opposite. The preliminary analysis correctly identifies the statement as sarcastic, requiring no significant changes.

The tweet reads: "@ban_postgate though, I suspect you don't actually care about the truth, so whatever, go troll someone else ;-)"

- The speaker implies that they believe @ban_postgate is not genuinely interested in the truth and is instead engaging in trolling behavior. The use of "so whatever, go troll someone else" suggests that the speaker is dismissive and frustrated with further engagement.
- The speaker likely thinks that the engagement or conversation with @ban_postgate is unproductive and not worth their time because they suspect a lack of sincerity or genuine intent from the other party.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks appear to be aligned; both indicate a belief that @ban_postgate is not interested in an honest or meaningful discussion.
- It does not seem that the speaker is pretending to have any particular attitude. The dismissive tone and use of a winking emoticon suggest they are fairly upfront about their skepticism and frustration with the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker implies that @ban_postgate is not genuinely concerned with the truth and is engaging in trolling, showing frustration and dismissiveness. The presupposition is that @ban_postgate's actions are insincere, which leads the speaker to believe the conversation is fruitless. The intent is likely to call out perceived trolling and discourage further interaction with @ban_postgate. The tone is negative, with a hint of sarcasm suggested by the winking emoticon, which often implies joking or light-heartedness, contrasting with the serious implication of trolling. There is no pretense in the speaker's tone, as their frustration and skepticism are clear. The literal meaning is a suggestion to stop trolling, while the implied meaning is accusing @ban_postgate of not genuinely caring about truth.

The preliminary analysis should remain consistent with the understanding that the statement is sarcastic. The apparent contradiction between the lightness of the winking emoticon and the accusatory tone underscores the sarcasm. The speaker implies a lack of genuine discussion, using sarcasm to critique and dismiss @ban_postgate's perceived trolling behavior.

"Driving into town on very well cleaned country road I see a tow truck veer off too far to shoulder & get sucked into ditch. #Irony"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that it is ironic for a tow truck, which is typically responsible for helping vehicles out of ditches or other problematic situations, to itself be pulled into a ditch. This role reversal is highlighted as unexpected and humorously paradoxical.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that the situation is amusing and perhaps indicative of a twist of fate or irony, as suggested by the use of the hashtag "#Irony."

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts align in highlighting the irony and humor of the situation where a tow truck found itself needing assistance rather than providing it.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; they genuinely find the situation ironic and humorous, as indicated by their choice of wording and use of the hashtag "#Irony."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis identifies several elements in the tweet. The implicature is highlighting the irony of the situation – a tow truck, usually helping others, is itself needing help. The presupposition is that tow trucks are expected not to get stuck, which makes the situation feel paradoxical. The intent of the speaker seems to be to express amusement and draw attention to an unexpected event. The polarity of the sentence is neutral to positive, given the humor in the situation. There's no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are genuinely amused by the irony. The literal meaning is that a tow truck got stuck, while the implied meaning hinges on the irony of the role reversal of a rescue vehicle needing rescue.

Upon reflection, the preliminary analysis effectively captures the essence of the tweet by noting the unexpected and humorous nature of the situation as ironic. The statement is not sarcastic; rather, it is a straightforward observation meant to point out the irony without pretension or hidden sarcasm. The use of "#Irony" directly indicates the nature of the humor without any underlying sarcasm.

"Being a light sleeper is the best. #not"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that being a light sleeper is not actually a positive experience, contrary to what their initial statement might suggest. The hashtag "#not" indicates sarcasm, implying that they find being a light sleeper undesirable.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker thinks that being a light sleeper is actually a negative experience. They probably find it inconvenient or bothersome, as it likely leads to easy disturbances during sleep.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the speaker's implication and their thoughts align in conveying that being a light sleeper is unfavorable.

The speaker is pretending to have a different attitude toward the situation at first by sarcastically saying "Being a light sleeper is the best," but the hashtag "#not" quickly reveals their true feelings about disliking it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Being a light sleeper is the best. #not" is an example of sarcasm. The speaker implies that being a light sleeper is not a positive trait, contrary to what the literal meaning of their statement initially suggests. The presupposition is that readers understand that about the common inconveniences associated with being a light sleeper, such as frequent disturbances. The use of the hashtag "#not" indicates the speaker's true intent, which is to convey dissatisfaction or annoyance with being a light sleeper.

The polarity of the last sentence is negative, as the use of "#not" negates the positivity implied by the initial statement.

The statement implies that Obama and Hillary Clinton assured Ukraine of protection if they disarmed, and there is a suggestion that this promise was not kept. The speaker seems to criticize the actions or inactions of Obama and Hillary, implying that their promise to Ukraine was insincere or not fulfilled. They believe that at least one of these assurances should be honored, indicating disappointment or dissatisfaction with the perceived lack of support for Ukraine.

The implication is that the speaker thinks the situation is one where promises were made to Ukraine and not kept, which they view negatively. The speaker is expressing a belief that there has been a failure in policy or international obligations.

What the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are aligned; both express the viewpoint that this promise to Ukraine was not honored, and this should be rectified. This demonstrates their disappointment and call for action consistent with what was promised.

The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their statement directly outlines their perception of a failure to keep a promise, suggesting a genuine disappointment and desire for the US to uphold its commitments.

1. **Implicature**: There's an implication that Obama and Hillary offered Ukraine protection, which the speaker believes was not delivered, leading to criticism of their inaction or broken promises.
2. **Presuppositions**: It assumes Obama and Hillary made a clear promise to protect Ukraine, and that this promise was conditional upon disarmament, which hasn't been fulfilled.
3. **Intent**: The speaker aims to draw attention to a perceived lapse in policy or international responsibility by implicitly criticizing Obama and Hillary. The speaker likely seeks to urge accountability or a change in policy.

"Look good feel good! #not #TeamNoSleep #cantopeneyes"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker is implying that despite the common belief that looking good leads to feeling good, they are not experiencing this currently. They are likely feeling tired and cannot fully open their eyes due to lack of sleep.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely feels exhausted and is being somewhat humorous or sarcastic about the disconnect between their appearance and how they actually feel. 

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, the implication and the speaker's thoughts align in suggesting that they are tired and not feeling well despite possibly trying to maintain appearances.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker appears to be expressing genuine feelings of fatigue, but they are using humor and sarcasm to convey this, rather than pretending to have a different attitude.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Look good feel good! #not #TeamNoSleep #cantopeneyes" is analyzed as follows:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker is implying a mismatch between the usual notion of "looking good and feeling good" and their current state, which is one of exhaustion.

2. **Presuppositions**: It’s taken for granted that the concept "look good feel good" is a common belief or saying.

3. **Intent**: The speaker intends to humorously highlight their contradiction between outward appearance and internal feeling of fatigue due to lack of sleep. They likely want to convey the struggle and irony of the situation to their audience, who shares or understands their plight.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence is negative. The use of #not and #cantopeneyes signifies complaint and fatigue.

5. **Pretense**: There isn't a pretense in the speaker's attitude. They are genuinely expressing tiredness, but they choose to do it with a sarcastic twist.

6. **Meaning**: Literally, the statement suggests feeling good by looking good, but implied meaning reveals the speaker feels tired and at odds with the saying they reference.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the speaker is expressing fatigue and using sarcasm to underscore the irony between appearance and reality. The humor is a cover for their exhausted state. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

The definition of #IRONY would be if a 77-year-old rapper went #viral and took #BITCOIN mainstream. Maybe only way #babyboomers will buy in.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that it would be unexpected and ironic for an elderly person, particularly a 77-year-old rapper, to popularize a modern digital currency like Bitcoin, considering the typical demographic associated with both rap music and Bitcoin is much younger.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears to think that the current adoption of Bitcoin among older generations, such as baby boomers, is low. They may find the idea of a 77-year-old rapper promoting Bitcoin humorous or unlikely, suggesting that it would take something as ironic as this hypothetical situation to get baby boomers to invest in or understand Bitcoin.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. They both suggest an element of humor and irony in the unlikely scenario of an elderly person, specifically a rapper, being the catalyst for mainstream Bitcoin adoption amongst baby boomers.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker seems to be employing humor or sarcasm in their statement rather than pretending to have a particular attitude toward the conversation. They are likely using irony to highlight the gap in Bitcoin adoption between younger generations and baby boomers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "The definition of #IRONY would be if a 77-year-old rapper went #viral and took #BITCOIN mainstream. Maybe only way #babyboomers will buy in." uses irony to juxtapose the unexpected scenario of an elderly rapper influencing the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, typically associated with younger demographics. The speaker implies it would be improbable and humorous if this were the catalyst for baby boomers to engage with Bitcoin, highlighting their low adoption so far.

The implicature involves the humor and improbability of the scenario, while the presupposition is that both rap music and Bitcoin are predominantly favored by younger people, not baby boomers. The speaker's intent is to humorously comment on the generational gap in Bitcoin adoption using a hypothetical situation. The polarity is slightly negative, as it points out a perceived reluctance among baby boomers to adopt new technologies like Bitcoin. There is no serious pretense; the statement is meant to be humorous or sarcastic.

The difference between literal and implied meaning is significant. Literally, it describes an odd situation, but implied, it suggests the unlikelihood of baby boomers adopting Bitcoin without such a surprising event.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic, as it uses irony to emphasize the unlikelihood of the scenario it describes. The humor comes from the absurdity of expecting a 77-year-old rapper to popularize Bitcoin among baby boomers.

The speaker states: "Girls won't answer their phone when I'm calling them bc they think I'm calling them in early but I'm actually calling to cut them #irony."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is a misunderstanding or a misconception from the girls' side regarding the intention behind the phone calls. They expect one thing—being called early—but the reality is different—the speaker intends to end things with them. The use of "#irony" suggests a disconnect between expectations and reality.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to find humor or irony in the situation. They seem to perceive it as ironic that the girls are avoiding the call for a reason they believe protects them from something uncomfortable (being called early), yet in reality, avoiding the call prevents them from hearing the speaker's intent to cut the relationship.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned in that they find irony in the situation. They recognize the misunderstanding and see it as an amusing twist of expectations.

The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude. Instead, they genuinely find irony in the situation and share it in a humorous tone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Implicature: The speaker implies that there is a misunderstanding on the girls' part—they avoid answering calls to dodge an anticipated situation of being called early, but ironically, the speaker's real intent is to end the relationship.

Presuppositions: It is presupposed that the girls know the speaker well enough to assume why they might be calling and that they are actively avoiding such calls.

Intent of the speaker: The speaker intends to highlight the irony and humor in the situation where the intention behind the call is opposite to what the receiver assumes. The speaker, likely male, wants to share a personal anecdote underlining the unexpected twist.

Polarity: The tone of the last sentence is neutral with a humorous undertone. The use of "#irony" indicates a non-serious, lighthearted tone.

Pretense: There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; the humor and irony are genuine observations.

Meaning: The literal meaning is about failed communication during phone calls, but the implied meaning is the ironic situation of assumptions leading to unexpected outcomes.

Upon reflection, the statement is not sarcastic. It genuinely finds humor in the miscommunication and the unexpected irony in the situation rather than mocking or conveying disdain. The use of "#irony" is apt for highlighting the discrepancy between expectations and reality without implying false intentions or emotions.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?

The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude. Their statement appears genuine, indicating a playful engagement with the process of refining their humor.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In the statement, the speaker humorously acknowledges that their sock joke might need improvement. The implicature is that the joke was not effective initially, possibly misunderstood or not well-received. The presupposition is that the joke had an audience who provided feedback or implied that it missed the mark. The speaker’s intent seems to be light-hearted engagement with others, maintaining a playful and open attitude toward improving their joke.

The polarity of the statement is neutral to positive, as it lacks any negative tone. There's no pretense in the speaker’s attitude, suggesting authenticity in their willingness to improve the joke.

Statement: "itsfunny bc people think im quiet|but im just listening toeveryones convos|and figuring out ur weaknesses|todestroy u later in life #sarcasm"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they may seem quiet and reserved, but they're actually observant and possibly strategic about gathering information on others. However, the hashtag "sarcasm" suggests that this might not be entirely serious.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker thinks that being perceived as quiet gives them the advantage of listening and potentially using what they learn to their benefit. They seem to find humor in the idea that a quiet demeanor could be misinterpreted in such a diabolical way.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Not exactly. While the implication is one of a calculated, perhaps slightly sinister intent, what the speaker actually thinks is likely less serious, considering the use of "sarcasm." They may find it amusing or ironic rather than genuinely sinister.

Finally, the speaker is likely pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. The use of sarcasm suggests they don't genuinely perceive themselves as a threat or have malicious intent; they are possibly mocking or exaggerating the stereotype of the "quiet" person for comedic effect.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature:** The speaker implies that while they may appear quiet, they are actually observant and gathering information, possibly for an advantage. However, the hashtag "sarcasm" suggests they are not entirely serious about using this information destructively.

**Presuppositions:** The statement presupposes that others perceive the speaker as quiet and possibly underestimate them, giving them an opportunity to observe unnoticed.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker seems to aim for comedic effect by exaggerating the stereotype of a "quiet" person being secretly strategic or sinister. They want to entertain or mock the idea that a quiet demeanor automatically hides malicious intent. The speaker is likely sharing this with a social media audience, possibly friends or followers who understand their humor.

**Polarity:** The tone of the statement is intended to be humorous and playful despite using words like "destroy."

**Pretense:** There is a pretense in the attitude, as the speaker pretends to be plotting against others, but it's not genuine due to the hashtag "#sarcasm."

**Meaning:** The literal meaning suggests a calculated intent to harm others based on observed weaknesses, but the implied meaning, strengthened by the sarcasm tag, is that this is not a serious statement but a joke.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The components of the analysis align: the speaker uses sarcasm to mock the notion that quietness masks sinister intentions, aiming for comedic effect rather than any real threat.

The statement is: "@CaleCowan your tongue in cheek @timescolonist weigh in does nothing but instigate breed specific hate. Stick to reporting on tuques. #yyj"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that Cale Cowan’s commentary, described as "tongue in cheek" in the Times Colonist, is promoting negative sentiments or prejudices against specific dog breeds.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker thinks that Cale Cowan's commentary is unproductive and potentially harmful. They believe it stirs up unnecessary negativity regarding certain dog breeds and sarcastically suggest that Cowan should focus on less controversial or less impactful topics, as evidenced by the mention of "tuques" (Canadian winter hats).

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts indicate dissatisfaction with Cale Cowan's commentary. The speaker criticizes the way Cowan addresses certain issues, perceiving it as irresponsible or inflammatory.

Finally, the speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their criticism seems genuine and aimed at discouraging certain reporting styles that may foster breed-specific hate.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement is directed at @CaleCowan and critiques their "tongue in cheek" contribution to the Times Colonist, suggesting it incites breed-specific hatred. The speaker implies that Cowan's commentary has a negative and harmful impact, specifically by promoting prejudices against specific dog breeds. The presupposition here is that Cowan's writing is not serious and is instead mocking or dismissive in nature. The speaker's intent is to criticize Cowan's approach and to suggest focusing on trivial topics instead, seen in the suggestion to report on "tuques" (a Canadian winter hat).

- **Implicature**: The commentary is not being taken seriously and is viewed negatively, as it incites specific hate.
- **Presuppositions**: Cale Cowan has previously reported on issues related to specific dog breeds and has mocked or been dismissive in the nature of his work.
- **Intent of the speaker**: To discourage the kind of reporting Cale Cowan has done, which they see as damaging, and to promote more responsible reporting.
- **Polarity**: The tone is negative, highlighting disapproval.
- **Pretense**: The speaker does not appear to pretend; their criticism seems genuine.

The literal meaning suggests that Cowan should not be reporting on serious issues and stick to innocuous topics. However, implied in the statement is a sarcasm that discredits Cowan’s work on serious topics by using "stick to reporting on tuques" as a mockery. 

Reflecting on the analysis, the implication, presuppositions, and intent clearly indicate a sarcastic tone. The speaker is not literally suggesting that Cowan switch topics but is instead criticizing the quality or content of Cowan’s work. The statement is sarcastic.

"Just wait till Cleveland comes again! #sarcasm"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker is implying that Cleveland coming again is not actually something to look forward to, despite the literal words suggesting anticipation or excitement. The use of "#sarcasm" indicates that the statement is not meant to be taken seriously or at face value.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely thinks that Cleveland's arrival or the event related to Cleveland is not impressive or desirable. They might expect it to be underwhelming or disappointing instead.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, what the speaker implies (that Cleveland's presence is not exciting) aligns with what they are likely thinking (that Cleveland may be underwhelming or disappointing).

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker appears to be using sarcasm to convey their true attitude, which is likely one of dissatisfaction or skepticism about Cleveland. Therefore, they are not pretending to have a genuine positive or anticipatory attitude; instead, they're using humor to express their true negative perspective.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker implies through their statement that the return or arrival of Cleveland is not genuinely something to look forward to, contrary to the literal excitement suggested by the words. This is underscored by the hashtag "#sarcasm," signaling that the statement is not meant to be taken seriously. The speaker likely views Cleveland’s coming as unimpressive, underwhelming, or even undesirable.

The implicature suggests that the speaker is making a critical or skeptical comment about Cleveland, taking for granted that the audience understands Cleveland's arrival will be disappointing or lackluster. The intent of the speaker, identified as @Atlantasportguy in the conversation, is to convey a negative sentiment about Cleveland humorously or ironically, aiming to share this perspective with @darrenrovell and @DJFJennings, who are presumably part of the same sports-related discussion.

The polarity of the statement is negative, given the sarcastic tone. There is indeed pretense in the speaker’s attitude; they pretend to look forward to Cleveland's return but actually expect it to be unimpressive.

In summary, the analysis correctly identifies the use of sarcasm to express an opinion contrary to the literal meaning, confirming that the statement is indeed sarcastic. The assessment does not require substantial changes; the statement is sarcastic as it both implies and suggests a negative view in a humorous way.

"What to do with that old #motherboard you have laying around. #NOT http://t.co/RjtcaMq9Gz #guitarpicks"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that transforming an old motherboard into guitar picks is not a practical or sensible idea. The hashtag "NOT" suggests that the link or idea is a joke or something the speaker believes should not be taken seriously.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to view the idea of converting a motherboard into guitar picks as humorous or absurd. They don't endorse the idea and are probably mocking or dismissing it as foolish.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think align in dismissing the idea as impractical or silly. The use of "NOT" clearly indicates a rejection of the idea.

The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude towards the conversation. Their use of the hashtag "NOT" suggests sincerity in their disbelief or mockery of the idea.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement in question is analyzed to determine whether it is sarcastic. Here is a breakdown of the key elements involved:

1. **The Implicature**: The speaker suggests, though not directly saying, that turning an old motherboard into guitar picks is an absurd or humorous notion. 

2. **The Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that an old motherboard is unlikely or impractical to have any conventional use as guitar picks.

3. **The Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker likely aims to entertain or amuse their audience by highlighting the absurdity of the idea. The speaker is using humor to engage their audience.

4. **The Polarity**: The sentence, with the inclusion of the hashtag "NOT," has a negative tone towards the feasibility or practicality of the idea.

5. **Pretense**: There does not appear to be pretense in the speaker's attitude. The use of "NOT" straightforwardly conveys disbelief or mockery without attempting to feign support or positivity.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests possible uses for an old motherboard, but the implied meaning, reinforced by #NOT, is that the supposed "use" is not to be taken seriously and is even ridiculous.

Based on the analysis, the use of "NOT" clearly indicates sarcasm, as it negates the feasibility of the idea humorously. The difference between literal and implied meaning further supports this. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"Even though @PGA_JohnDaly's got more ex-wives than @PGATour majors, I'm happy for that washed-up mess... #Not!! #Blocked"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are actually not happy for John Daly, despite the sarcastic phrasing suggesting otherwise. The use of "#Not!!" and "#Blocked" indicates that any positive sentiment is sarcastic and in reality, they harbor negative feelings. The speaker is implying that John Daly's personal life, namely having multiple ex-wives, and his career in golf, suggest he's a 'washed-up mess'.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker clearly thinks unfavorably of John Daly.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they are. The sarcastic statement and the hashtag "#Not!!" explicitly express disdain. What the speaker implies through sarcasm aligns with their negative thoughts about John Daly.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.

- **Implicature:** The speaker implies that the tradition of the "elf on the shelf" was expected to be upheld to maintain the magic of Christmas for their child, and its omission has led the child to question the authenticity of Christmas traditions.

- **Presuppositions:** There is an assumption that the "elf on the shelf" is an integral part of the Christmas tradition for the child and that it contributes significantly to the belief in Christmas magic.

- **Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker aims to convey concern over the situation where forgetting to move the elf resulted in a child's existential question about Christmas. The speaker seems to reach out to a broader community with the mention of "@NannyProbss," perhaps for empathy, advice, or shared experiences.

- **Polarity:** The tone of the statement is negative, as indicated by the emoticon "😥" expressing distress.

- **Pretense:** There is no pretense evident in the speaker's attitude; their concern appears genuine and heartfelt.

- **Meaning:** Literally, the statement describes a failure to move an elf figure, but implied is the deeper concern about the potential damage to a child's belief in Christmas.

**Reflection & Decision on Sarcasm:**

The analysis shows that the speaker genuinely expresses concern over the consequence of forgetting to move the elf. The distress emoticon supports sincerity in their emotion. There is no mockery, exaggeration, or ironic intention discernible in the statement. Hence, the statement is not sarcastic. The focus should remain on the genuine concern about maintaining the child's belief in Christmas traditions.

The tweet states: "@IsaJennie @deray @Nettaaaaaaaa but of course it was. Cops could shoot a black man in front of a hospital & I bet you he'd still get no aid."

- The speaker implies a deep skepticism and cynicism regarding the potential for justice and medical assistance for black men who are victims of police violence, highlighting a grim expectation of racial discrimination and lack of accountability.
- The speaker appears to believe that systemic racism is so entrenched that even in a scenario where aid should be readily available, it would still be denied if the victim is a black man.
- What the speaker implies and what they think are aligned: both convey a sense of hopelessness and critique of systemic injustice and racism.
- The speaker does not appear to be pretending; their statement seems to reflect a genuine attitude of frustration and condemnation toward ongoing racial inequities.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis examines the speaker's tweet about police violence and racial discrimination. The analysis identifies the speaker implies skepticism about justice and medical assistance for Black victims of police violence, suggesting systemic racism wouldn't allow aid even when it's clearly needed. The presupposition is that systemic racism and lack of accountability are pervasive. The speaker's intent is to highlight racial injustice and critique systemic issues, directed at both the tagged users and a broader audience concerned with such matters. The tweet's polarity is negative, demonstrating frustration. There's no evidence of pretense; the tone is earnest in conveying the critique.

Reflecting on this analysis, the statement can be seen as sarcastic. The literal meaning states a belief that no aid would be provided, but the implied meaning criticizes the system for its failure to offer justice and aid, despite what should be expected. Thus, the statement uses sarcasm to emphasize the disparity between what should happen (providing aid) and the cynical expectation of reality (denial of aid due to systemic racism).

The tweet states: "Blue skies, warm air, and the royal accommodation! #WhatMoreDoesOneNeed #Education? #Not... http://t.co/mEtHUIaAtR http://t.co/CsW0rfhGZZ"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that the environment and amenities they are currently enjoying are so ideal or luxurious that they seemingly fulfill all essential needs, possibly making the pursuit of education (or something else implied) unnecessary or trivial in comparison to the current comfort.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely feels content, relaxed, and perhaps a bit humorous or sarcastic about their current situation, suggesting that the immediate physical comforts they are experiencing are sufficient to satisfy them, at least at the moment.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both imply that the current comforts and luxuries could momentarily outweigh other pursuits like education, though this is likely said in jest or as a hyperbolic statement. The hashtags suggest a facetious tone, questioning the necessity of something profound like education when simple pleasures seem fulfilling at the moment.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker seems to adopt a tone of sarcasm or humor, suggesting they might be poking fun at the idea that one could forgo education or other pursuits because of their current comfortable state. It’s likely they don’t genuinely believe education is unnecessary but are using the hyperbolic statement to express enjoyment of the moment’s luxuries.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This analysis identifies the speaker's statement as sarcastic. The tweet contrasts the luxuries of "blue skies," "warm air," and "royal accommodation" with the hashtag #Education? #Not, implying the irony of neglecting education for temporary indulgence. The implicature suggests that while the immediate comforts are enjoyable, they are trivial compared to significant pursuits like education. The presupposition is that education is inherently valuable, and the juxtaposition with seemingly superficial pleasures highlights the absurdity of disregarding it. The speaker's intent appears to be humor or sarcasm, aiming to entertain or provoke thought among readers.

The polarity of the statement is humorously positive, appreciating the current situation, but with a sarcastic undertone. There's a pretense in feigning neglect of education for transient comfort, indicating sarcasm. The literal meaning suggests contentment with comfort, but the implied meaning criticizes the idea of deprioritizing education.

Reflecting on the analysis, the initial conclusion is confirmed. The statement is sarcastic, as it humorously juxtaposes the ephemeral pleasure of comfort against the lasting importance of education, using hyperbole and irony. This sarcastic tone underscores the speaker's enjoyment of their current situation while mocking the notion of diminishing education's value.

The preliminary analysis of the tweet suggests that the speaker is expressing genuine gratitude towards @StevePulcinella and @Coseph05 for their help in perfecting and teaching their bench press technique. The acknowledgement of "props on form from lifters in AL" indicates that the speaker's improved form has been recognized by other lifters, likely from Alabama, and the hashtag #DYEL (Do You Even Lift) might serve as a humorous tag related to gym culture, rather than sarcasm.

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies that their bench press form has improved significantly due to the help they received, and this improvement has earned them recognition.
- **Presuppositions**: It's taken for granted that @StevePulcinella and @Coseph05 were involved in the speaker's bench training and have effectively contributed to their success.
- **Intent**: The speaker aims to express gratitude and share their sense of achievement. The intended audience includes the mentioned individuals and potentially others in their lifting community.

The statement is: "I just wrote a 13 page paper... I was awfully tired when I was writing it and now I can't sleep. #irony"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is a level of irony in the situation. They were very tired while writing a lengthy paper, yet now that they have finished, they are unable to fall asleep, which contrasts their earlier state of fatigue.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker finds it amusing or ironic that despite being very tired during the writing process, they are unable to sleep once the task is completed. They may find the situation somewhat frustrating as well, but are choosing to highlight the irony of it.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think highlight the irony of being unable to sleep after feeling exhausted from writing a paper.

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation; they genuinely find the situation ironic and choose to share this perspective humorously.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis identifies the implied irony in the speaker's situation: they were tired while writing a 13-page paper but can't sleep after finishing it. The presupposition is that writing such a long paper would make someone exhausted enough to sleep easily.

The polarity of the last sentence is neutral to slightly negative, as it reflects on an inconvenience. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they genuinely find it ironic and are not being deceptive.

The literal meaning of the statement highlights the task of writing a 13-page paper and the resultant inability to sleep. The implied meaning emphasizes the contradiction and humor in not being able to sleep despite having been very tired.

Reflecting on this analysis, it should remain consistent with the understanding of irony, which can sometimes align with sarcasm if there's a mocking or bitter tone. However, the statement seems more like an earnest expression of irony rather than sarcasm. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that generalizing the behavior of all police officers based on the actions of a few is unfair and unjust, similar to how racists make generalizations about certain groups based on the actions of a few members of that group. This statement suggests that such broad characterizations are inherently flawed and contradictory.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears to disagree with the practice of generalizing all police officers as problematic due to the misconduct of a minority within their ranks. They likely think that it mirrors the flawed logic used by racists, and thus it is unjust and unreasonable.

**Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that some people are generalizing all police officers due to the misconduct of a subset, and that this is a known issue.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker aims to criticize and point out the hypocrisy in generalizing all cops based on the actions of a few, similar to how racists would stereotype entire groups. The use of "#Irony" suggests the speaker is drawing attention to the contradictory nature of such generalizations.

The preliminary analysis reveals that the statement "When ya mates dad starts poking you on Facebook #Cringe 😲😬" is expressing genuine discomfort and embarrassment. The implicature indicates that there is an implied breach of social boundaries, making the situation awkward. The presupposition is that interactions between friends' parents and oneself on social media, particularly through Facebook's "poke" feature, are generally considered inappropriate or uncomfortable. The speaker’s intent seems to be sharing their awkward experience and possibly seeking solidarity or humor from an audience who can relate.

The tone of the last sentence is negative, which is highlighted by the use of the term "cringe" and the discomfort emojis. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude, as their expression of discomfort appears sincere. The literal meaning is that a friend's dad is interacting on Facebook, but the implied meaning goes beyond this and conveys that such an interaction is socially awkward and undesirable.

The speaker tweeted: "That was the case, not the recording. So comparing the two is apple & oranges."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is a misunderstanding or a misalignment in comparing a "case" to a "recording," suggesting that they are fundamentally different and therefore incomparable.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely believes that the comparison being made is invalid or misguided. They are emphasizing that the two items being compared need more similarity for a proper comparison.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts are consistent in conveying that the comparison being discussed is not valid or appropriate due to the intrinsic differences between a case and a recording.

The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; instead, they directly express their viewpoint that comparing the two items is inappropriate.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement implies a fundamental misunderstanding or misalignment in comparing a "case" to a "recording," which are seen as fundamentally different entities. The presupposition is that the speaker believes these two items cannot be validly compared due to their inherent differences. The intent of the speaker is to clarify or correct the misunderstanding by pointing out the incomparability, likely addressing another participant in the conversation (@lnritter_).

The last sentence "So comparing the two is apple & oranges" carries a negative tone, as it dismisses the attempted comparison as inappropriate or misguided. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they straightforwardly express that the comparison lacks validity.

The literal meaning of the statement is that the two items (case and recording) are being compared incorrectly. The implied meaning further stresses that such a comparison is invalid due to their intrinsic differences, similar to the cliché "comparing apples and oranges."

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it seems accurate in capturing the speaker's straightforward intent to correct a misunderstanding. The analysis clearly identifies the negative tone and lack of pretense.

Since there is no pretense or hidden meaning beyond the clarification, the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker is directly addressing a perceived error in logic.

"Congress just screwed us but it's a great day in the District because we got another stadium! #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are dissatisfied with Congress's actions, suggesting that the approval or decision to build another stadium is not actually beneficial or a priority for the District's community.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems frustrated and possibly cynical about the decision made by Congress. They likely believe that the decision does not address more pressing issues and that the announcement of a new stadium is superficial or misplaced.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts indicate a sense of dissatisfaction and perhaps a belief that priorities are misplaced by celebrating such developments while feeling "screwed" by Congress.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude through the use of sarcasm. The hashtag explicitly indicates that their statement is not intended to be taken at face value and that they are, in fact, critical of the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker uses sarcasm to highlight their dissatisfaction with Congress, implying that the construction of another stadium is misplaced and not a genuine cause for celebration. The use of the hashtag "#sarcasm" clearly indicates that the statement is not literal but critical of Congress's priorities. The speaker's intent is to criticize the situation while pretending to have a positive attitude, which is indicated by using sarcasm to express a negative opinion of Congress’s actions. The polarity of the statement is negative, as it reflects frustration and dissatisfaction about priorities within the District.

In summary, the statement is indeed sarcastic, as it contrasts the literal expression of a "great day" with the implied criticism of Congress’s actions. The analysis correctly reflects the sarcasm in tone and intent. There is no need for changes in the preliminary analysis.

"Not everyone's really for you no matter how long you knew them. And not everyone's a bad person just because it's been a short time. #irony"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the longevity of a relationship or an acquaintance does not necessarily determine loyalty or character. They suggest that people you've known for a long time might not truly support you or have your best interests at heart, while someone you've known for a shorter period might be more genuine or kind.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to be reflecting on the irony of relationships and how they can be misleading. It appears they believe that assumptions based on the duration of knowing someone can often be flawed or surprising.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the speaker's implication and thought align, indicating a recognition of the complexity and unpredictability of human relationships, ironically challenging the typical expectations of trust and value based on time.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; rather, they seem genuine in their ironic observation about how time doesn't necessarily equate to true loyalty or goodness in people.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

The speaker's statement touches on the ironic reality of human relationships, emphasizing that the duration of knowing someone doesn't necessarily correlate with their loyalty or moral character. The implied message is that long-term acquaintances may not truly support you, while recent acquaintances can be genuine, contradicting common societal expectations. The speaker's intent seems to be a genuine reflection on this irony without any pretense in their attitude. The tone of the statement appears neutral or reflective rather than overtly positive or negative.

**Analysis:**

- **Implicature:** The speaker implies that the quality of a relationship isn't determined by its length, highlighting an ironic twist to common beliefs about relationships.
- **Presuppositions:** It is assumed that society generally believes longer relationships inherently hold more value or trustworthiness.
- **Intent of the speaker:** The intent is likely to provoke thought about the nature of relationships and challenge the listener's assumptions.
- **Polarity:** The tone remains neither strongly positive nor negative, as it offers a contemplative, rather than emotional, insight.
- **Pretense:** There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; the observation seems honest.
- **Meaning:** The implied meaning questions societal norms about relationship dynamics, differing from the literal idea that time alone builds trust or virtue.

**Assessment:** Given the lack of pretense, directness of the reflection, and absence of overt negative or mocking tone, the statement is not sarcastic. The use of "#irony" reinforces the speaker's recognition of the contradiction without insincerity. The preliminary analysis correctly discerns these aspects, and there are no significant changes needed in that evaluation.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

- What does the speaker think about the situation?

### Reflection:

- The analysis clarifies that the speaker is using sarcasm, especially evidenced by the hashtag #sarcasm and the context of calling their friend a "brat."
- The polarity, pretense, and meaning reveal that the speaker's humorous tone masks genuine mild annoyance.

The tweet in question is: "@PRoseish_2 @mcspocky more people are in prison because of drug related crimes. But you know gun crime is up #sarcasm"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that while a significant number of people are incarcerated due to drug-related offenses, there is a frustrating or ironic focus on the rise in gun crime. They are likely suggesting that the issue of gun crime is being overemphasized or misstated compared to drug-related crime incarcerations.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker believes that drug-related crimes result in more incarcerations compared to gun crimes, and possibly that there should be more attention on this issue. The use of sarcasm indicates they may think the emphasis on gun crime does not align with the actual data on incarceration reasons.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they both seem to reflect the speaker's belief that there's a discrepancy in the attention or seriousness given to gun crime compared to the realities of incarceration related to drug offenses. The sarcasm points to their frustration with the characterization of gun crime as a more dominant factor without data-backed support in terms of jailings.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm to convey a critical or dismissive attitude towards the claim or belief that gun crime is the predominant issue. They are likely trying to highlight a perceived inconsistency in public attention or narrative when it comes to the causes of incarceration.

Statement for analysis: "Take a look at those calves!!! 😎😎😂😂 ladies love the calves! #not #about #the #arms #its #about..."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is showcasing a noticeable enthusiasm or pride about having well-defined calves, suggesting that it's an important or attractive feature. By stating "ladies love the calves," the speaker is implying that this trait is particularly appealing to women.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to find humor in the emphasis placed on calves over arms, as indicated by the laughing emojis "😂😂". They might be poking fun at the conventional focus on arm muscles, suggesting that there is a new, unique value in having muscular calves.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts align with the idea that calves are an underrated yet attractive feature. The tongue-in-cheek tone indicates the speaker recognizes the humor or irony in focusing on calves instead of the traditionally admired arm muscles.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
It seems the speaker is not pretending but rather enjoying a playful or joking attitude. The use of sunglasses emojis and laughing emojis suggests a lighthearted, possibly ironic approach to discussing the appeal or importance of well-formed calves over commonly admired arm muscles.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To analyze the statement, let's start with the implicature: the speaker implies that there's a humorous, unexpected focus on calves as an attractive feature rather than the more traditionally admired arm muscles. The presuppositions are that there's a common societal emphasis on muscular arms and that the speaker assumes the audience understands this cultural norm.

The speaker's intent is to humorously suggest that calves are now the body part to admire, potentially poking fun at fitness trends or societal perceptions. The polarity of the tone is light-hearted and positive, as indicated by the emojis used.

There is a pretense in the speaker's attitude: they pretend to seriously advocate for the attractiveness of calves while actually joking about the concept. The literal meaning of the statement is that "ladies love muscular calves," while the implied meaning is mocking the idea by overemphasizing it.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, while it correctly identifies the joking tone and humor in the statement, it misses the sarcasm layered in the excessive enthusiasm for calves. Given the use of the hashtag "not" and the laughing emojis, the statement can be classified as sarcastic; the speaker does not genuinely believe calves are more important than arms and pokes fun at the idea.

The speaker's tweet reads: "Oh dear, some people don't get #irony 😳".

- The speaker implies that there are individuals who fail to understand or recognize ironic situations. By using the hashtag #irony and the emoji 😳, the speaker may also imply a level of surprise or disbelief at this lack of understanding.
- The speaker thinks that not understanding irony is notable or perhaps frustrating, given their use of "oh dear" and the embarrassed emoji which suggests a mild level of embarrassment or shock.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are aligned. They imply there is a lack of comprehension among some people regarding irony, and they think this is worth pointing out or highlighting, possibly because they find it surprising or slightly embarrassing.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The statement assumes that understanding irony is common knowledge or expected, demonstrated by the use of "oh dear" and an embarrassed emoji. The intent of the speaker seems to be to highlight the perceived lack of comprehension with mild surprise, perhaps aiming to connect with others who share this sentiment.

The polarity of the last sentence is negative, as it points out a deficiency in understanding. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they genuinely seem to find it noteworthy or amusing that some people don't understand irony. The literal meaning aligns closely to the implied meaning, emphasizing a disconnect between the speaker's expectations and the reality regarding comprehension of irony.

Upon reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it remains accurate in identifying the key elements of the statement. Given the elements, it can be determined that the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"Making the most out of my last vacation day. #not #tvandsleep"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are not actually making the most out of their last vacation day, contrary to what one might expect someone to do. Instead, they are spending it doing what is typically considered unproductive activities like watching TV and sleeping. 

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to express a sarcastic or humorous dissatisfaction with how they are spending their vacation day. They are aware that their actions do not align with the stereotypical notion of maximizing one's time, such as doing exciting or meaningful activities.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they are saying the same thing. The speaker implies through sarcasm that they are not using their day in a productive or fulfilling way, and this matches their apparent self-deprecating acknowledgment of how their day is actually being spent.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is displaying a sarcastic attitude, likely feigned to express humor or acceptance of their less-than-ideal use of time, rather than genuine frustration or disappointment.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement "Making the most out of my last vacation day. #not #tvandsleep" implies that, contrary to the literal meaning, they are not making the most out of their last vacation day. They are engaging in activities like watching TV and sleeping, which are usually seen as unproductive. The hashtag "#not" reinforces the sarcasm, indicating a humorous or ironic take on how little they are doing. 

The presupposition here is that typically, one would try to use their vacation days for adventurous or significant activities, implying that watching TV and sleeping don't fit this notion. The intent of the speaker seems to be to express a humorous dissatisfaction with their current situation while possibly drawing empathy or amusement from their audience.

The polarity of the last sentence is negative, as it conveys a sense of underwhelming use of time. There is a pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they are exaggerating their dissatisfaction for comedic effect. The literal meaning suggests they are maximizing their day, but the implied meaning, aided by the hashtags, reveals the opposite.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it correctly identifies that the statement is sarcastic. The speaker uses sarcasm to humorously highlight the gap between what they could be doing on a vacation day versus what they are actually doing. There is no need for changes in this analysis.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

- **Intent**: The speaker aims to express their intense frustration humorously by exaggerating their mood. The emoji and hashtag indicate an attempt to elicit empathy or amusement from others rather than concern.

- **Polarity**: The tone is negative, emphasizing the speaker's displeasure with waking up in a bad mood.

- **Pretense**: There's no genuine pretense, as the speaker's use of hyperbole and the hashtag reflect self-awareness and control over their emotions.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing? Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think reveals their desire to be let out of the dance early.

Finally, the speaker doesn't appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their appeal to the snow suggests a genuine wish or desire to leave early, rather than adopting a particular attitude for effect or performance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the speaker is expressing a genuine hope for a weather event, specifically snow, to provide them an excuse to leave a dance early. The implicature is that the speaker finds the dance undesirable and is seeking a natural interruption. The presupposition is that heavy snow could potentially result in the early dismissal of events. The speaker's intent appears to be a wishful plea rather than a sarcastic remark, aimed at either themselves or those who would decide on early dismissal.

The polarity of the statement leans negative, as it associates a desire to leave the dance with a wish for inclement weather. There's no clear evidence of pretense; the desire seems authentic rather than performed. The literal and implied meanings align closely, both revolving around the hope for snow to justify leaving the event early.

Reflecting on the analysis, it seems the speaker's statement is not sarcastic. The desire to leave early and the wish for snow are directly stated and appear earnest rather than an attempt at irony or sarcasm. No changes to the preliminary analysis seem necessary in this context.

The speaker tweeted: "You want to see something Irish!! Of all the reasons to be closed 😂😂😂 http://t.co/ePyGvA9pwU #irony"

- The speaker implies there is a humorous or unexpected reason behind an establishment being closed, and they find this situation amusing, evident from their use of laughter emojis and the hashtag "#irony". By mentioning "something Irish", they may be insinuating that the closure reason is characteristically Irish in a stereotypical sense.
- The speaker thinks the situation is entertaining or absurdly unexpected, as suggested by their laughter emojis and the use of the hashtag "#irony", which indicates they find it ironically fitting or amusing in context.
- Both what the speaker implies and what they explicitly state suggest amusement and surprise at the reason for closure. Their use of humor aligns with their perception that the situation is ironic or unexpectedly stereotypically Irish.
- The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; they appear genuinely amused, highlighting the irony and amusement in the situation with emojis and a tongue-in-cheek use of "#irony".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The implication in the statement is that there is a humorous, ironic, or absurd reason for something being closed, which the speaker associates with a stereotypically Irish characteristic or situation. It presupposes that the audience has some awareness of Irish stereotypes or common clichés, as well as understanding what might be seen as humorously ironic in this context. The speaker intends to share a laugh and highlight what they see as an unexpectedly funny situation, perhaps making a cultural observation, and the tone is positive and light-hearted because of the use of laughter emojis and the hashtag "#irony".

The polarity in the speaker's comment is mostly positive due to the humor expressed through emojis and the ironic tone. There is no particular pretense in the speaker's tone; the amusement seems genuine. The literal statement refers to seeing "something Irish," while the implied meaning focuses on a culturally linked, humorous irony that led to a closure, which might not be clear until the linked content is viewed.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it captures the main points clearly. The statement relies on irony and stereotypes for humor, and the suggestion of irony confirms that it's meant to be sarcastic. Therefore, the statement is sarcastic, using humor to point out an unexpected closure reason attributed to something Irish.

The statement is: "@WendyWilliams that's some bullshit that's a complete rip off for those items. And I bet some of u idiots really that's a good sale. #NOT"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the prices for certain items being discussed are unfairly high and that individuals who think it's a good deal are mistaken or not thinking critically.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker clearly believes that the sale or prices being offered are excessive and not a bargain at all. They seem to think that people who believe otherwise are not using sound judgment.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the speaker’s implication and direct expression align. Both suggest that the sale is a poor deal and criticize those who think it is worthwhile.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending; they appear genuinely frustrated or annoyed with the situation and with those who perceive it differently. Their language and tone indicate a candid expression of their opinion.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let's analyze the statement:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that the prices are unjustifiably high and that anyone who doesn't see through the marketing ploy is not critically evaluating the situation.

2. **Presuppositions**: It's taken for granted that there is a sale involving certain items and that Wendy Williams or her brand is related to these items in some way. The speaker also presupposes that there are people who perceive these prices as a good deal.

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to criticize both the pricing of the items and the intelligence or judgment of individuals who think the sale is favorable. The speaker likely feels frustrated with what they perceive as a marketing scam or misrepresentation.

4. **Polarity**: The tone is negative. Words like "bullshit," "rip off," "idiots," and the hashtag "#NOT" express strong disapproval and disdain.

5. **Pretense**: There seems to be no pretense in the speaker's attitude; the message appears to be a direct and honest expression of their opinion.

6. **Meaning**: Literally, the speaker describes the sale as unfair and those who believe it's a "good sale" as foolish. The implied meaning expands on this by suggesting a lack of awareness or understanding among the consumers.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it accurately captures the speaker's frustration and criticism. However, the sarcastic hashtag "#NOT" after stating that people think it's a good sale signals sarcasm in mocking those who fall for what the speaker believes is a deception.

Conclusively, the statement is sarcastic, as the hashtag highlights the contrast between what might be assumed about the sale and what the speaker truly thinks.

Just walked in to #Starbucks and asked for a "tall blonde" Hahahaha #irony

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they find humor in the situation because "tall blonde" is a term that can refer to two different things: a coffee order at Starbucks (where "tall" is a size and "blonde" refers to a type of roast) and a description of a person (a tall, blonde-haired individual). The irony comes from the dual meaning and potential for misunderstanding.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker finds the situation amusing and entertaining, as indicated by their use of "Hahahaha" and the hashtag #irony, which suggests they appreciate the double entendre.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the speaker's implication of finding humor in the situation aligns with their personal amusement and enjoyment of the irony.

-The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. They genuinely find the situation funny and are sharing their amusement with others.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**The Implicature:** The speaker implies that there is humor in the phrase "tall blonde" due to its dual interpretation: as a Starbucks coffee order and as a description of a person. The hashtag #irony highlights this unexpected juxtaposition that may lead to a misunderstanding.

**The Presuppositions:** It is assumed that the audience understands the two meanings of "tall blonde": one being a Starbucks drink size and roast type, the other being a description of a person's physical attributes.

**The Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker intends to share their amusement with others by highlighting the humorous ambiguity of language. The speaker is likely an individual commenting on their experience and sharing with a social audience for entertainment.

**The Polarity:** The tone of the sentence is positive, as the speaker finds enjoyment in the situation.

**Pretense:** There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are genuinely amused.

**Meaning:** Literally, the statement could refer to either ordering a coffee or describing a person. Implied, it highlights the humor found in language's double meanings, emphasizing irony.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it remains consistent that the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker is genuinely amused by the irony rather than expressing a contrary sentiment. Thus, the statement is humorous, but not sarcastic. There is no need for changes in the analysis.

"Found my motivation... Aka the back of my eye lids, by accident. Boy, me and @Kels_efollin are some winners. #not #senioritisisreal #losers"

- The speaker implies that they are feeling unmotivated and instead of being productive, they inadvertently ended up resting or sleeping. They make a sarcastic remark about being "winners," indicating that they do not view their lack of motivation as positive.
- The speaker thinks the situation is somewhat humorous and ironic, as indicated by the use of sarcasm and hashtags like #not and #losers. They seem to acknowledge that they are succumbing to "senioritis," a term often used to describe a lack of motivation among students nearing graduation.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think appear to align. They use humor and sarcasm to express their frustration or resignation about their lack of motivation.
- The speaker is likely not pretending to have a certain attitude; their humorous and sarcastic tone suggests they are genuinely poking fun at their lack of productivity.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker is making a sarcastic statement about their lack of motivation and productivity by humorously referring to their "motivation" as nothing more than sleep or rest. The use of hashtags like #not and #losers alongside "Boy, me and @Kels_efollin are some winners" highlights the irony and sarcasm in the statement, as they clearly don't believe they are "winners" in the traditional sense. The speaker presupposes that the audience understands "senioritis" as a common term for a lack of motivation, especially for seniors in school nearing graduation. The intent is to humorously acknowledge and share their struggle with others who may relate.

The polarity of the statement is negative, reflecting frustration with their lack of productivity. There is no pretense in the speaker’s attitude; they are open about their current state using humor. The literal meaning—that they found motivation—is contradicted by the implication that they actually found an absence of motivation. Thus, the statement is clearly sarcastic.

The speaker tweeted, "i literally love when someone throw me in at the deep end #irony #tough #life."

- The speaker implies that they experience situations where they are suddenly placed in challenging circumstances without preparation or support. 
- The speaker likely finds these situations difficult, as indicated by the use of hashtags like #irony, which suggests the literal statement is not genuine, and #tough.
- The speaker's implication (finding the situation challenging) and what they actually think (not genuinely loving it) are not the same. The use of #irony indicates they don't truly enjoy being in such situations.
 
It seems the speaker is pretending to have an attitude of enjoyment toward these situations, which is ironic since the underlying message shows they don't actually like it. The sarcastic tone reveals frustration or discomfort with being abruptly thrown into difficult or unfamiliar circumstances.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement from the tweet is sarcastic. Here's the breakdown of the analysis:

1. Implicature: The tweet implies that the speaker often finds themselves in difficult situations without preparation, and they sarcastically claim to "love" it.

2. Presuppositions: It is taken for granted that being "thrown in at the deep end" is a challenging and potentially unpleasant experience.

3. Intent of the Speaker: The speaker, likely frustrated with being in tough situations without support, hopes to express their dissatisfaction through sarcasm. The use of #irony suggests they want to highlight the discrepancy between what they are saying and what they truly mean.

4. Polarity: The tone is negative, as indicated by the hashtags #irony and #tough, which signal that the situations are not enjoyable.

5. Pretense: The speaker pretends to express enjoyment, but their actual attitude is one of frustration or discomfort.

6. Meaning: The literal meaning ("I love being in tough situations") contrasts with the implied meaning (that these situations are unpleasant).

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it accurately identifies the sarcastic nature of the statement, as it uses irony to convey the speaker's true feelings of discontent. No changes are necessary, and the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"Scoped out a new route on today's 5k. But oh.. the crowds, the traffic, the noise 😄 #not... http://t.co/yYGdZiRwfZ"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that the new route they tried for their 5k run was not enjoyable because it was crowded, had a lot of traffic, and was noisy.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely finds the crowded, traffic-heavy, and noisy new route to be unpleasant for running. However, the use of humor with the "😄" emoji and the hashtag "#not" suggests that they are trying to downplay their dissatisfaction or possibly make light of the situation.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, the speaker's implication about the unpleasantness of the situation matches their likely thoughts on the situation. However, the use of humor and perhaps sarcasm suggests that they are trying to present their dissatisfaction in a light-hearted manner.

Finally, the speaker may be pretending to have a more jovial attitude towards the conversation than they actually feel, as indicated by the use of humor and the playful tone in their statement. The hashtag "#not" may indicate sarcasm or irony, further suggesting that their true feelings about the situation are not entirely positive.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis identifies that the speaker is not genuinely pleased with the new route for their 5k run due to the crowds, traffic, and noise. The use of the emoji "😄" and the hashtag "#not" suggests sarcasm or irony, as these elements conflict with the dissatisfaction implied in the text. The statement likely pretends to be light-hearted, but the actual sentiment is negative.

The implicature in the statement is that the speaker did not enjoy their experience due to external distractions. The presupposition is the expectation that a new route might offer a better experience, which turns out to be false for the speaker. The speaker's intent is probably to share their frustration while maintaining a humorous tone with their audience.

The polarity of the statement is negative, given the description of undesirable elements (crowds, traffic, noise). The pretense is evident in the playful tone, which disguises actual disappointment. The literal meaning highlights the presence of crowds and noise, whereas the implied meaning conveys displeasure and irony through humor.

Considering the analysis, nothing significant needs to be changed. The statement employs sarcasm effectively to articulate the speaker's dissatisfaction. Thus, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

The tweet states: "Chocolate Chocolate babe gets dicks in asshole."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is explicit sexual content involving a person described as "Chocolate Chocolate babe," which is portrayed in a derogatory or objectifying manner with a focus on anal intercourse.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears to trivialize or potentially sensationalize the situation by using language that objectifies and focuses explicitly on sexual acts, likely for shock value or to promote adult content.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts revolve around objectification and the sexual nature of the content being promoted.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
It seems likely that the speaker is not pretending, but rather attempting to attract attention or engagement through inflammatory language, consistent with the promotion of explicit content.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Summarizing the preliminary analysis:

The tweet references explicit content with a focus on sexual activity involving a person described as "Chocolate Chocolate babe." The statement implicitly suggests the existence of explicit sexual material and does so in a potentially objectifying manner. The speaker appears to trivialize or sensationalize the situation for shock value or promotional purposes, which aligns with promoting adult content.

Upon evaluating whether the statement is sarcastic:
- The implicature involves promoting explicit content by using shocking and objectifying language.
- The presupposition is that such language and content are common enough to attract attention without further clarification.
- The speaker likely aims to attract attention or provoke engagement, possibly for promotion purposes. 
- The polarity is negative due to the objectifying and explicit nature of the content.
- There isn't a clear pretense of a different attitude; the speaker does not seem to hide their objectification or attempt to feign sincerity.
- The literal and implied meanings align closely; both revolve around explicit and objectifying content promotion.

Given these aspects, the statement is not sarcastic. It appears to be a straightforward but deliberately provocative promotion of explicit content. The preliminary analysis aligns with this conclusion, as there is no pretense indicative of sarcasm in the statement.

"Change is a Process, ||#Not an Event dafuq you thinking"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that someone or some group is mistakenly perceiving change as something that happens instantaneously or in a singular moment, rather than understanding it as a gradual and ongoing process.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker believes that there is a misunderstanding or incorrect assumption about the nature of change. They seem frustrated or exasperated—indicated by the use of "dafuq"—that someone is not seeing change for what it truly is: a process rather than an event.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts are expressing the same idea that there is a flawed understanding or oversimplification of how change occurs.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending; they seem genuinely frustrated or incredulous about the misunderstanding regarding the nature of change. The use of informal and strong language suggests a direct and candid expression of their feelings on the matter.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement implies that someone is viewing change incorrectly, as an event rather than a process. The speaker presupposes that change is inherently gradual and ongoing, taking for granted that this view is the correct perspective. Their intent is likely to correct or criticize the misconception, conveyed with a tone of frustration. The polarity of "dafuq you thinking" carries a negative tone, emphasizing the speaker's exasperation. There is no evident pretense; the speaker's candor seems genuine. The literal meaning of the statement defines change as a process, but the implied message is a critique of the listener's misunderstanding.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the speaker doesn't appear to employ sarcasm. The incredulity and criticism in the statement are straightforward without the indirection or contrast typically found in sarcasm. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

The statement is: "Absolutely no #ALP or @jrobertsonmp fan, but seriously many have done this before him & many will. #Scapegoat #Excuse he was a lame duck."

- The speaker implies that while they do not support the Australian Labor Party (ALP) or the particular individual, J Robertson, they believe that whatever actions are being criticized have been done by others in the past and will continue to happen. They suggest that Robertson is being unfairly targeted or used as a scapegoat and that he was ineffective or powerless ("a lame duck").
  
- The speaker seems to think that this situation is unjust or typical in political scenarios, indicating a level of cynicism or resignation about political accountability, as many before and after Robertson might engage in similar conduct without being held accountable.

- What the speaker implies and what they think appear to align: they imply an understanding or hindsight bias about repetitive political misconduct and express a belief that blaming Robertson is an oversimplification or unfair act of scapegoating.

The speaker is not pretending to have a particular attitude; they seem genuinely critical of both the actions being discussed and the political dynamics that allow such actions to go unpunished while particular individuals are singled out as scapegoats.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement criticizes the political dynamics and suggests that the speaker is skeptical about the accountability within the political system. They imply that singling out J Robertson is an act of scapegoating, noting that similar actions by others have occurred and will continue. The speaker seems to express a resigned acceptance of repetitive political misconduct and feels that this is a typical scenario. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they appear genuinely critical of both the situation and the broader political framework.

- **Implicature**: The statement implies that blaming Robertson is more about using him as a scapegoat than addressing systemic issues, as many politicians have acted similarly.
- **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that such actions are common in politics and will continue to occur. 
- **Intent**: The speaker aims to critique the political system and the unfairness of targeting individuals like Robertson as scapegoats.
- **Polarity**: The tone of the statement is negative, especially due to the use of terms like "scapegoat" and "lame duck."
- **Pretense**: There is no evident pretense; the speaker appears genuine in their critique.
- **Meaning**: The literal meaning discusses political actions, while the implied meaning critiques the unjust use of scapegoating and highlights systemic issues.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement could be seen as sarcastic because it juxtaposes a refusal to support Robertson with a critical view of him being used as a scapegoat, suggesting an underlying cynicism about political accountability. The keywords "scapegoat" and "excuse" could hint at sarcasm as they reveal the speaker's disbelief in the justness of the blame placed on Robertson. Therefore, the statement could be regarded as sarcastic.

The speaker said: "I actually think he needs to use the youngsters in this reincarnation #irony".

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the current situation involves someone, probably a coach or a manager, needing to use younger players or individuals. The use of "#irony" suggests that there’s a contradictory or unexpected element to this advice.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely believes that relying on younger talent would be beneficial or necessary in this context. However, by noting the irony, they might think there's a discrepancy between what's happening and what they believe should be happening or perhaps that there is an ironic twist in the outcome when younger players are used.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Not entirely. The speaker implies one course of action—using younger players—but the use of the word "irony" suggests that they may actually be highlighting a contradiction or discrepancy between expectation and reality. There might be skepticism or critique about whether younger players will indeed be used effectively or about the situation as a whole.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker might be using irony to disguise their true feelings about the situation, possibly highlighting the absurdity or the humorous aspect of the current circumstances. They might be pretending to simply make a straightforward suggestion while actually pointing out the irony or contradiction in the context with some level of skepticism or criticism.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**The Implicature:** The speaker implies that there's an expectation or suggestion for someone to use younger individuals, possibly in a professional or developmental setting. By tagging "#irony", they signal that there's an element of contradiction or unexpectedness connected to this suggestion.

**The Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that there is a situation involving a coach or manager contemplating the use of younger players and that something about the current approach or situation is ironic or contradictory.

**The Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker's intent may be to critique or highlight the paradox or inefficiency in the current scenario by pointing out the irony. The use of "#irony" suggests a possible discrepancy having perceived failure or disillusionment in the expected actions. The speaker is likely addressing individuals familiar with the situation, possibly followers of a particular team or project.

**The Polarity:** The tone appears to have a negative undertone since the use of "irony" often conveys criticism or disapproval.

**Pretense:** There is pretense in the speaker's statement. While they outwardly appear to offer a suggestion, the use of "#irony" exposes their skepticism and perhaps sarcasm about the idea or its practicality.

**Meaning:** The literal statement suggests a recommendation to use younger players, whereas the implied meaning, emphasized by "irony," points out a flaw, contradiction, or discrepancy in the situation—suggesting the speaker's true attitude is sarcastic.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement seems sarcastic. The use of "#irony" underlines a sarcastic view, ultimately signaling that the speaker does not believe the advice is either being taken seriously or that the expected outcomes are contradictory to reality.

The tweet reads: "That awkward moment when you plane your whole day around your Golf Class, and it gets cancelled! #stupidrain"

The statement is: "@_Liam_Walker_ @TheOxfordMail A thief, a liar, a vote rigger, mocks those who use food banks and an online bully #irony"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the person they are referring to—likely a public figure—is being hypocritical or morally dubious. The use of the term "irony" suggests that there is a contradiction between how this person presents themselves and their actual actions or character traits.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to disapprove strongly of the actions or behavior of the person they are referring to. The labels used ("thief," "liar," "vote rigger," "mocks those who use food banks," and "online bully") indicate a very negative opinion.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the speaker's implication and thoughts align, both presenting a very negative critique of the person’s behavior and character.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending; they seem genuinely critical and disdainful of the person they are discussing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement presents a highly negative view of a person, characterized as a "thief, liar, vote rigger, someone who mocks those who use food banks, and an online bully." The hashtag "#irony" implies that the person targets others for behavior they themselves exhibit or that there is a stark contrast between their public persona and private actions.

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that there is a significant contradiction between the characteristics/behavior of the person and how they portray themselves or how others may expect them to behave.

2. **Presuppositions**: The speaker takes it for granted that the audience understands who the person is and their alleged actions, as well as why these actions are considered hypocritical or ironic.

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to criticize and highlight the perceived hypocrisy or moral failings of the person they are referring to, likely intending to garner disapproval or highlight this behavior to others. The speaker seems to be someone who disapproves of and wants to draw attention to the person's negative behavior.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the statement is overwhelmingly negative, as it lists a series of defamatory character traits and actions.

5. **Pretense**: There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; their criticism appears genuine.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning lists negative actions and traits, while the implied meaning highlights the hypocrisy or contradiction in the person's behavior compared to their likely public image or claimed moral standing.

Reflecting on this analysis, the statement can be considered sarcastic. The use of the term "irony" and the context suggests sarcasm, as the speaker finds it absurd that someone with such traits would mock or critique others. The statement's sarcastic nature is rooted in exposing the contradiction and supposed moral inferiority of the person it targets.

The tweet states: "Alien dit : What is #Religion, it is a culture that has been invented by a #Fool who wanted to do everything that is #Not legal #Legally."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that religion is a construct created by someone with foolish intentions, possibly to provide a legal or socially acceptable framework for actions that would otherwise be considered illegal or taboo.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely has a negative view of religion, seeing it as a misguided or deceptive system that permits questionable or unethical behavior under the guise of legitimacy.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they likely think about the situation are aligned. They both suggest a skeptical or critical stance toward religion, portraying it as a manipulative or nonsensical human invention.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
There is no indication that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude; the tone suggests a genuine expression of disdain or criticism toward religion. The use of hashtags and the anthropomorphizing of an "alien" delivering the statement might be an attempt at humor or satire, but it does not appear to conceal their actual stance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The tweet is a critical statement about religion, implying it is a construct designed by a fool to legitimize actions that would otherwise be illegal or immoral. The speaker seems to hold a negative opinion of religion, viewing it as a deceptive or flawed system. The use of an "alien" as the speaker introduces humor or satire, but it aligns with their genuine disdain toward religion. The tone is negative, and there is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; their criticism appears genuine.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement can be seen as sarcastic. The use of an "alien" supposedly commenting on human culture implies a level of absurdity, and the exaggeration that religion was invented by a "fool" adds a layer of sarcasm to underscore their critical view. Thus, while the speaker's criticism appears direct, the satirical framing suggests sarcasm.

**Implicature:** The speaker implies that there is some unwritten rule or societal expectation that one must celebrate their birthday strictly on the birth date, and they are challenging or questioning this norm.

**Intent of the speaker:** The speaker is aiming to express their viewpoint that it's acceptable to celebrate one's birthday beyond the actual day. They are likely trying to convey a sense of freedom and fun associated with their personal choice and to encourage others to feel similarly about celebrating.

"#tbt #not Dedicated to those days we DONT want to throwback to. Like this evil cold November day at... http://t.co/XX2tszIP77"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there are certain past experiences, specifically mentioning a cold November day, that are not fond memories and they would prefer not to revisit or remember these particular moments. By using "#tbt #not," they reference the popular Twitter trend "Throwback Thursday" (TBT) in a sarcastic manner, suggesting that not all past days are worthy of nostalgia.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker has a negative sentiment towards this particular time or memory. It is clear they did not enjoy that specific cold November day and they are expressing relief or satisfaction in not having to relive it, thus the use of the word "evil" to describe the day.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

The statement is reflective of a negative sentiment towards a specific past experience characterized as an "evil cold November day." The use of the #tbt (Throwback Thursday) and #not hashtags suggests sarcasm, as they typically reference fond nostalgia, but the speaker uses them to highlight a memory they do not cherish. The speaker implies and directly states their dislike for this past experience, employing a humorous tone to emphasize their negative feelings. 

**Analysis:**

- **Implicature:** The speaker implies that not all past experiences are worth reminiscing about positively, referencing the specific cold November day as something undesirable.
- **Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that the audience is familiar with the concept of #tbt and the nature of Throwback Thursday as something usually associated with nostalgia.
- **Intent:** The speaker intends to humorously express their negative feelings towards a past event, using sarcasm to add emphasis. The speaker appears to be an individual who is reflecting on past experiences through social media.
- **Polarity:** The overall tone is negative, as indicated by the description of the day as "evil" and the explicit wish to avoid revisiting it.
- **Pretense:** There does not appear to be pretense; the speaker genuinely dislikes the memory and uses sarcasm to highlight that.
- **Meaning:** The literal meaning of the statement might be interpreted as expressing genuine nostalgia for the day, but the implied meaning, supported by the sarcastic use of hashtags, clearly communicates distaste instead.

Reflecting on the analysis, it is clear that the statement is indeed sarcastic. The literal use of #tbt is contrasted with the negative description of the day, along with the inclusion of #not, which directly negates the nostalgic connotations of Throwback Thursday. Therefore, the preliminary analysis is accurate in identifying the sarcasm present in the statement.

"Nice weather for today.. #not 😠"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker is implying sarcastically that the weather is not nice at all. By using "#not" and an angry face emoji, they are expressing dissatisfaction and frustration with the current weather conditions.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the statement contains sarcasm. The speaker implies that, contrary to the literal meaning of "Nice weather for today," the weather is indeed unpleasant. This is underscored by the use of "#not" and an angry face emoji, indicating dissatisfaction. The presupposition here is that the audience understands the common tropes of sarcasm on social media, especially when paired with such hashtags and emoticons. The speaker's intent appears to be to express frustration or annoyance, and possibly to commiserate with an audience who might share their sentiment.

The polarity of the speaker's final remark is negative, indicated by both the hashtag and the emoji. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude as they genuinely appear to express dissatisfaction. The literal statement says the weather is nice, but the implied meaning, fortified by context cues, is the exact opposite.

In reflection, the preliminary analysis correctly interprets the sarcasm. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"@Tesco Yeah thanks for messing me about and then not delivering on the product, i feel really great about how this went down!! #Not #Thanks"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that Tesco failed to deliver a product as promised and that they've been inconvenienced or possibly misled by Tesco's behavior.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is clearly frustrated and dissatisfied with Tesco's handling of the situation. They are using sarcasm to express their disappointment.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the expressed viewpoint reveal dissatisfaction and sarcastic frustration with Tesco's service.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm, which suggests that they are pretending to have an attitude of gratitude while actually conveying the opposite. This stylistic choice underscores their dissatisfaction.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement implies that there is dissatisfaction with Tesco's service, as they indicate that Tesco did not deliver a promised product, inconveniencing the speaker. The presupposition is that Tesco had previously agreed to deliver a product, which did not occur. The speaker's intent is to express frustration and dissatisfaction to Tesco, likely seeking acknowledgment or resolution. The polarity of the message is negative, though it's cloaked in ostensibly positive language, such as saying they "feel really great," which is intended sarcastically. There's pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they feign gratitude while actually criticizing Tesco's service. 

The difference between the literal and implied meaning is stark; the literal phrasing suggests satisfaction, but the hashtags "#Not #Thanks" invert this to convey the true negative sentiment. 

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it's clear that the statement heavily relies on sarcasm to highlight the speaker's negative experience with Tesco. There is no need for significant changes to the analysis. The statement is confirmed to be sarcastic.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "It makes me weak everytime Sica ;_;" seems to imply a sincere emotional response towards Jessica's (referred to as "Sica") public display of tears at a fan signing event. The speaker appears to be deeply moved and empathetic towards Jessica's situation. The use of the sad emoticon ";_;" underscores the sentiment of vulnerability or sorrow the speaker experiences when witnessing Jessica's emotional moment. There is no indication of the speaker pretending to have a particular attitude; the statement seems genuine, reflecting a heartfelt reaction.

The implicature here is that the speaker is emotionally invested in Jessica's well-being and is affected when she shows sadness. The presupposition is that Jessica's tears are something noteworthy and impactful to the speaker. The intent of the speaker, presumably a fan or admirer, is to express support and emotional connection with Jessica. The polarity of the statement is negative due to the context of shedding tears and the emotive reaction described.

The overall analysis suggests that there is no sarcasm in the statement. The speaker's reaction is genuine, heartfelt, and devoid of any mocking or sardonic tone. Therefore, this statement is not sarcastic.

Statement: "I saw a leaf blowing in the breeze. You could yell at that if you wanted to?"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is little point in getting upset or raising one's voice about something as trivial as a leaf blowing in the breeze. They may be indirectly suggesting that someone else is overreacting or getting frustrated over something insignificant.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely thinks that the situation is insignificant or not worth getting worked up about. They may view any excessive reaction as unnecessary or even absurd.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, what the speaker implies aligns with what they think. Both suggest a dismissive attitude towards the idea of becoming upset over something minor or inconsequential.

Finally, the speaker is likely pretending to have a sarcastic or humorous attitude toward the conversation, using the metaphor of yelling at a leaf to highlight the futility of getting upset over trivial matters.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Preliminary Analysis Summary:**

The statement "I saw a leaf blowing in the breeze. You could yell at that if you wanted to?" implies that it is futile to get upset over trivial matters. The speaker seems to suggest that there is someone who might be overreacting to minor issues, and they use the metaphor of yelling at a leaf to humorously express this opinion.

- **Implicature:** Beyond the literal, the statement implies that the addressee's potential frustration is as pointless as getting upset with a leaf in the breeze.
  
- **Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that there is an option to yell at non-threatening, insignificant things which, of course, would be nonsensical.

- **Speaker's Intent:** By using this metaphor, the speaker likely hopes to highlight the absurdity of overreacting to trivial things, making the point in a humorous way. The speakers involved are likely someone observing and critiquing the excessive reactions of another person.

- **Polarity:** The overall tone of the sentence is negative, lending a critical or mocking tone.

- **Pretense:** There is pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they are intentionally framing their remark in a humorous way with an underlying critical tone about the futility of the situation.

- **Meaning:** The literal meaning is about yelling at a leaf, while the implied meaning critiques someone overreacting over something insignificant.

In reflection, the statement uses sarcasm through the stark contrast between the literal and implied meanings, and through the exaggerated suggestion that one could yell at a leaf. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"You think my mom and I would get along better, she's a middle child too. #irony #middlechildsyndrome"

- The speaker implies that despite the expectation that they would have a better relationship with their mom due to a shared middle child experience, this is not the case. They seem to find it ironic or unexpected that their shared middle child status does not lead to better understanding or camaraderie between them.
- The speaker seems to find the situation frustrating or disappointing since the shared characteristic does not result in the harmonious relationship one might expect. The use of hashtags "irony" and "middlechildsyndrome" indicates that they might view this commonality as something more problematic or a source of misunderstanding rather than bonding.
- What the speaker implies (the shared status should lead to a better understanding) and what they think (it does not in reality) are contrasting ideas; they highlight an expectation versus reality scenario. The speaker is drawing attention to this discrepancy through their tone and word choice.
- The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; rather, they are openly expressing their disbelief or frustration about the irony of the situation through the hashtags used.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies it is ironic or unexpected that they do not get along better with their mom, despite both being middle children, which theoretically should foster better understanding due to shared experiences.
   
2. **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that being middle children should naturally lead to better understanding and bonding. 

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker is aiming to express their frustration or disbelief at the lack of expected rapport with their mother. They use irony to highlight the discrepancy between expectation and reality regarding their relationship.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence is negative, as it conveys disappointment rather than the expected harmony from a shared characteristic.

5. **Pretense**: There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; the expression of irony and frustration seems genuine.

6. **Meaning**: The literal expectation is that being middle children would naturally align the speaker and their mom, leading to a closer relationship. However, the implied meaning is that this expectation has not been met, leading to an ironic and unsatisfying situation.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The use of irony and contrasting expectations versus reality indicates sarcasm.  The speaker uses sarcasm to highlight their frustration and disbelief about their relationship with their mom, despite sharing middle child syndrome.

The speaker stated: "#Irony: 'The elections are not over zero VAT, but about whether there will be a Zionist or extremist country here'."

- The speaker implies that the true focus of the elections is on much larger, more critical issues of national identity and ideology (Zionist vs. extremist) rather than more mundane or technical issues like taxation (zero VAT). By using the term "irony," the speaker suggests that the public discourse or official narrative may not be acknowledging these larger concerns upfront.

- The speaker seems to think that the mainstream dialogue about the elections might be missing the mark by focusing on less significant issues. They suggest that the real stakes involve fundamental questions about the nation's future direction in terms of ideology and political alignment, which they find ironic because these are much more crucial matters.

- Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker explicitly states seem to be aligned. Both indicate dissatisfaction with the focus of the election debate, suggesting that it should be on ideological and national identity issues rather than economic policies like VAT.

The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; their use of the word "irony" conveys genuine criticism and possibly frustration over the perceived mismatch between public/election discourse and what they consider to be the real issues at stake.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis indicates that the statement is highlighting the perceived irony in election priorities. The speaker implies that the true focus should be on significant ideological issues, such as the country's identity as Zionist or extremist, rather than on technical economic issues like zero VAT. This suggests a disconnect between the mainstream election discourse and the speaker's view of the real stakes, which they consider critical to the nation's future.

The intent of the speaker is to critique this perceived misfocus, likely hoping to shift the attention of the dialogue towards these fundamental issues. The use of "#Irony" suggests dissatisfaction and a bit of frustration, indicating a negative tone in terms of polarity.

The term "irony" and the overall sentiment both have elements of criticism without obvious pretense. There seems to be alignment between the literal and implied meanings, with the speaker straightforwardly expressing their discontent.

Considering the analysis, the statement can be seen as sarcastic, given its use of irony to underline the speaker’s belief that the more substantial issues are being overlooked in favor of less significant ones.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

The speaker says, "That's comfortably the most stonewall penalty I've ever seen.. What are these refs on? #hadone #Stoke"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there was a very clear and obvious penalty in a soccer game that was not called by the referees. They are expressing disbelief and frustration toward the referees' decision.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that the referees made an incorrect decision by not awarding a penalty in a situation they believe was unquestionably deserving of one. They are likely frustrated and perhaps skeptical about the competence or fairness of the referees.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both imply and express directly that the speaker believes the referees made a glaring mistake by not calling a penalty, suggesting amateurism or incompetence on the part of the referees.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending; they seem genuinely frustrated and incredulous about the referees' decision in the game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To determine if the statement is sarcastic, let's break it down further:

- The Implicature: The speaker implies that the referee's decision was clearly incorrect, as the penalty seemed obvious.
  
- The Presuppositions: The speaker presupposes that the audience understands the context of sports refereeing, particularly in soccer, and the expectation for referees to make correct calls.

- The intent of the speaker: The speaker aims to express frustration and incredulity at the referees, possibly to vent or rally agreement from others on social media.

- The Polarity: The tone is negative, reflecting dissatisfaction and disbelief at the referee's competence.

- Pretense: There appears to be no pretense; the speaker's frustration seems genuine.

- Meaning: The literal meaning is that the penalty was very clear; however, the implied meaning is critical of the referees' failure to call it, suggesting incompetence or oversight.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis: The statement uses sarcasm. The phrase "That's comfortably the most stonewall penalty I've ever seen" is likely sarcastic, emphasizing how obvious the call should have been, and thus exaggerating the incompetence suggested in "What are these refs on?" The speaker intends to highlight the referees' apparent oversight in a hyperbolic and ironic manner to underline the perceived absurdity of the situation.

Thus, the statement is sarcastic.

Statement: "Oh I just love when I wake up with a migraine 😒 #not #needmeds"

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that waking up with a migraine is undesirable and likely wants relief from the pain, as indicated by the hashtag "#needmeds," which suggests they are seeking medication to relieve their symptoms.

The tone is negative, reflecting discomfort and irritation, rather than pretense.

Reflecting on this, nothing should change in the analysis—it's clear that the statement employs sarcasm effectively to convey the speaker's dissatisfaction with their situation.

"Love the way @virginmedia says fault from last night will be fixed by 4pm, only to see a man in a van pull up at 4pm to fix the fault #irony"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that Virgin Media's assurance about the fault being fixed by 4pm was misleading or impractical since the repair person only arrived at the exact time they promised the issue would be resolved. There's an implication of inefficiency or unreliable service on the part of Virgin Media.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to express frustration or amusement at the perceived inefficiency or irony of the situation. The use of the word "irony" suggests that the speaker finds the timing rather contradictory or humorous.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies about the inefficiency of the service closely aligns with what they are thinking—expressing irony and dissatisfaction with the situation.

The speaker seems to be pretending to take the situation humorously, as indicated by the use of sarcasm in "Love the way." Though the expression shows frustration, it is masked with sarcastic praise, suggesting underlying annoyance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**The Implicature:** The speaker implies that Virgin Media's promise was unrealistic or unreliable because the repair was not completed by the promised time, as the technician only arrived then. This implies inefficiency or a lack of urgency in their service.

**The Presuppositions:** The presupposition is that when Virgin Media stated the fault would be fixed by 4pm, it was expected that the fix would be complete by then, not that the repair process would just begin at that time.

**The Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker, likely a dissatisfied customer, aims to highlight the inefficiency or impracticality of Virgin Media's service, possibly to express frustration or draw attention to the problem through the use of sarcasm.

**The Polarity:** The tone of the sentiment is negative, as it points to a failure to meet expectations.

**Pretense:** The speaker pretends to appreciate the service with "Love the way," which is sarcastic because the true sentiment is one of dissatisfaction.

**Meaning:** Literally, the statement expresses love for the timing of the repair, but the implied meaning is criticism of Virgin Media's failure to meet expectations.

**Preliminary Analysis Reflection:** The preliminary analysis accurately captures the sarcasm in the statement. The phrase "Love the way" is not genuine praise but is used sarcastically to express dissatisfaction with Virgin Media's service timing. 

The statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker uses irony to criticize Virgin Media's service by pretending to admire what they clearly find inadequate or absurd.

- The speaker implies that the girls from the show "Sorority Sisters" expected to gain wealth and fame from their participation, but in reality, their situation turned out differently, possibly in a disappointing or humorous way.
- The speaker seems to think that the situation is ironic or amusing, as the implied outcome for the girls is not what they envisioned. The tone suggests a sense of mocking or criticism toward the girls' expectations.
- Yes, the speaker's implication and their thought appear to be aligned. Both suggest the notion that the girls' expectations were overly ambitious or unrealistic and that the actual outcome did not meet those expectations.
- The speaker is likely not pretending to have a certain attitude; they genuinely seem to find humor or irony in the discrepancy between the girls' expectations and reality.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The speaker's intent is to mock the girls on the show and entertain the audience by highlighting this irony. The polarity leans negative, indicating the outcome was not favorable. There is little to no pretense; the speaker genuinely critiques the girls' ambitions.

The literal statement suggests a straightforward expectation of wealth and fame, while the implied meaning conveys failure and irony.

**Preliminary Analysis Summary:**

The statement suggests an ironic situation where the speaker, in their attempt to organize their books, ends up forgetting to take a book with them. The speaker finds this situation humorous or ironically amusing, as indicated by the hashtag "#irony". The speaker's implication aligns with their thoughts, highlighting the irony and unexpected twist of the circumstances. The analysis concludes that the speaker is genuine in their acknowledgment of irony, with no pretense involved.

**Reflection and Final Decision:**

1. **Implicature:** The speaker is highlighting the irony that their efforts to organize their books resulted in forgetting to bring a book, emphasizing the unexpected and counterproductive outcome.

2. **Presuppositions:** The speaker takes for granted that organizing books typically involves remembering and handling books, and forgetting one is an unexpected consequence.

3. **Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker aims to share a light-hearted, humorous situation with their audience, likely to entertain or acknowledge the quirks of everyday life.

4. **Polarity:** The tone is mild and possibly positive, given the use of humor and irony.

5. **Pretense:** There doesn't appear to be any pretense in the speaker's attitude. They sincerely find the situation to hold an element of irony.

6. **Meaning:** Literally, the statement describes a sequence of events leading to a forgotten book. Implied, it expresses the ironic twist of intentions versus outcome.

**Decision:**

The statement can be considered sarcastic in a mild sense, as sarcasm often incorporates irony and humor. However, it is more aligned with simple irony than typical sarcasm, as it lacks the biting or mocking tone usually associated with sarcasm. Therefore, while the statement uses irony, calling it sarcastic might be an overreach. The original analysis accurately captures the humor and intention without assigning sarcasm.

"@Margoandhow @imalexbeamyrnot spawn of Larry Ellison aka World's Worst Human"

- The speaker implies that being associated with Larry Ellison is a negative thing by using the phrase "spawn of Larry Ellison aka World's Worst Human." This suggests that they hold a strong negative opinion about Larry Ellison.
- The speaker clearly thinks very negatively about Larry Ellison, possibly viewing him as having done things that warrant him being labeled as the "World's Worst Human." The use of hyperbolic language indicates strong disdain.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are conveying the same strong negative sentiment toward Larry Ellison. The speaker's wording directly reflects their negative view.
- The speaker is not pretending to have a different attitude; their statement transparently expresses disdain towards Larry Ellison. There is no indication of irony or sarcasm, just direct criticism.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis correctly identifies the strong, negative sentiment from the speaker towards Larry Ellison, labeling him as the "World's Worst Human." The implicature suggests that any association with Ellison is undesirable. The presupposition is that Larry Ellison has done something that justifies such a harsh label, which the speaker takes for granted as common knowledge or acceptance. The intent is clearly to criticize and disparage, aiming to align with anyone else who may hold similar negative views. The tone of the message is blatantly negative.

The analysis confirms that there is no pretense or irony; the message is straightforward in its negative assessment. Thus, the meaning of the statement aligns with its literal interpretation. 

The statement is not sarcastic. The speaker is earnestly conveying their negative opinion without using sarcasm to highlight an incongruity. The preliminary analysis accurately captures this sentiment with no need for revision.

The statement is: "Exam na jud. Merry christmas. ||#Sarcasm|#KillUsSlowly"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that having exams during the Christmas season feels particularly burdensome and unpleasant, rather than joyful or festive. The use of "#Sarcasm" suggests that the statement "Merry christmas" is intended ironically.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely feels stressed or overwhelmed about having to focus on exams during a time typically associated with relaxation and celebration. The phrase "#KillUsSlowly" suggests they might be experiencing frustration or exhaustion.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's actual thoughts reflect a dissatisfaction with the timing of the exams, using sarcasm to express their discontent with the situation.

The speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation through sarcasm; they are pretending to wish a "Merry Christmas" while actually communicating the opposite.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Exam na jud. Merry christmas. ||#Sarcasm|#KillUsSlowly" suggests the speaker feels negatively about having exams during the Christmas season. They're indicating that exams at this time are burdensome and unpleasant, contrasting with the festive nature typically associated with the holiday. The use of "#Sarcasm" implies the "Merry christmas" part of the statement is meant ironically, as the speaker doesn't actually feel merry due to the exams. The hashtag "#KillUsSlowly" further reveals their frustration or weariness, exaggerating the impact of exams during this period. The use of sarcasm reflects their dissatisfaction and stress regarding the situation. 

The speaker's intent is to express dissatisfaction and perhaps garner sympathy or agreement from others who might be experiencing similar stress. There is a negative tone due to the implied frustration and ironic use of "Merry christmas." The pretense is indicated by the sarcastic wish of a "Merry Christmas," contrasting with the literal cheer of the phrase. The literal meaning of saying "Merry Christmas" is overridden by the implied meaning, highlighting their frustration with exams.

Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic, as it uses irony and exaggeration to convey the speaker's true feelings about having exams during the Christmas season.

The speaker states, "I feel and look like shit. #rainyday #nomakeup #sorrynotsorry http://t.co/xxPU1lb2ki."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the current conditions or circumstances (potentially a rainy day and not wearing makeup) are contributing to them feeling and appearing less than their best.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker openly acknowledges feeling and looking poorly but pairs this with the hashtag #sorrynotsorry, suggesting they are not overly concerned or apologetic about it. The hashtags and tone suggest a level of acceptance or indifference about their situation.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they align. The speaker implies that circumstances are affecting their mood and appearance but suggests a carefree or defiant attitude towards it with #sorrynotsorry. This implies they are content with letting go of societal expectations for appearance, at least for this moment.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
It does not seem like the speaker is pretending. The use of #sorrynotsorry typically indicates a genuine acceptance of their state, suggesting that they are comfortable with their appearance and feelings, and choose to express this unapologetically.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the speaker expresses feeling and looking unattractive, attributed to the conditions like a rainy day and lack of makeup. They pair this with a carefree attitude indicated by the hashtag #sorrynotsorry, implying they're not apologetic for feeling or looking this way. This suggests the speaker's acceptance of their state, defying societal appearance norms, reflecting honesty rather than pretense. The analysis infers no pretense in the speaker's tone nor a sarcastic undertone.

Upon reflection:

- The implicature suggests a correlation between external conditions and personal appearance.
- The presupposition is that rainy days and no makeup generally contribute to a less polished look.
- The speaker's intent appears to be to share their current, raw state without seeking validation.
- The polarity of the statement, especially with #sorrynotsorry, is more neutral or accepting rather than explicitly negative.
- There is no pretense; the speaker seems genuine in their acceptance of their appearance and feelings.
- The literal meaning aligns with the implied meaning, as the speaker genuinely appears to be sharing their current state without feigning indifference.

Based on this analysis, the statement does not seem sarcastic. The use of #sorrynotsorry conveys a straightforward acceptance rather than a concealed frustration or irony.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis:

Implicature: The speaker is implying that they find the Bob Ross tattoo interesting and worth sharing with a wider audience.

Presuppositions: The speaker assumes that their audience is familiar with Bob Ross and the cultural context around him that makes a tattoo of him noteworthy.

Intent: The speaker's intent is to share something they find intriguing and hope to spread it further by encouraging retweets. They seem to be a social media user promoting content potentially for personal enjoyment or visibility.

Polarity: The tone of the statement is neutral to positive, as the speaker seems enthusiastic about the subject.

The speaker tweeted: "and as much as I want to connect .. I like only the people who dont want to .. #Irony #Why oh why?"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to be expressing frustration or bewilderment about this ironic situation. The use of "Irony" and "Why oh why?" suggests they find this pattern to be inexplicable and possibly frustrating.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

Finally, it's unlikely that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. The expression seems genuine and reflective of a personal realization or ongoing struggle.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**Presuppositions:** There is an assumption that the speaker genuinely wants to build relationships, and there's a consistent pattern of being drawn to uninterested individuals.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker is probably sharing a personal observation, expressing frustration, and possibly seeking empathy or relatability from their audience on social media.

**Polarity:** The tone of the statement is negative due to the apparent frustration implied by the words "Why oh why?" and the use of the hashtag "Irony."

**Pretense:** There's no apparent pretense; the speaker appears to be sincere and honest about their feelings.

The tweet states: "@Elena_in_Rome easiest CL group with two rubbish teams but we won only 1 CL game - even that lucky last minute pen#not good enough#gutted"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the group their team is in for the Champions League (CL) is relatively easy, considering it contains two weak or "rubbish" teams. However, despite the perceived ease, their team managed to win only one game, and that win was barely secured through a last-minute penalty.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is clearly disappointed with their team's performance. They feel that the team's achievement of winning only one game in an easy group is inadequate (hence, "not good enough") and express their disappointment by saying they are "gutted."

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they are saying the same thing. The implication of a poor performance in an easy group aligns with the speaker's expressed disappointment and view that the team's performance is below par.

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; their genuine disappointment and frustration with the team's performance are clear and openly expressed in this statement.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker implies that despite being in an "easy" Champions League group, the team performed poorly, as they secured only one win, which itself was barely achieved through a last-minute penalty. The speaker presupposes that an easy group should result in more victories and feels the team's performance is insufficient. The intent of the speaker, who is likely a fan, is to express dissatisfaction and disappointment with their team's performance.

The polarity of the statement is negative, as indicated by expressions such as "not good enough" and "gutted." There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude as the statement directly conveys their genuine disappointment. The literal meaning matches the implied message that the team underperformed.

Therefore, there is no sarcasm in the statement. The speaker's literal expression and implied meaning both demonstrate clear and genuine criticism and disappointment, aligning consistently with the negative outcome they describe. Nothing should change in the preliminary analysis—the statement reflects straightforward frustration, not sarcasm.

Summary of Preliminary Analysis:
The statement implies dissatisfaction and frustration due to security issues with a PlayStation product. It presupposes that there is a significant flaw in the security system, leading the speaker to return the PS4. The intent of the speaker, presumably a customer, is to express disappointment publicly, likely hoping to spark a response or change from PlayStation.

Reflective Analysis:
The preliminary analysis accurately identifies the sarcastic nature of the statement, especially through the use of contrasting hashtags.

The statement being analyzed is: "@YasminaBen1 please note #sarcasm in last tweet before you kill yourself ;) many good pros including @BalancePhysio can show you best usage"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that their previous tweet was intended to be sarcastic and is warning the mentioned individual not to take it seriously or be offended by it. By saying "before you kill yourself," they may be implying that the person could take the previous tweet very seriously or be dramatically affected by it.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to think that there was a misunderstanding or potential for offense in their last tweet, hence the need to clarify that it was sarcastic. They may believe the topic or the tweet itself needed the skills or knowledge of professionals, as they mentioned "many good pros including @BalancePhysio."

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and what the speaker thinks align in trying to convey that the prior tweet was sarcastic and shouldn't be taken seriously, potentially avoiding harm or misunderstanding. Both aim to mitigate any negative reactions by implying the situation warrants professional guidance.

Finally, it's plausible that the speaker is pretending to have a casual or humorous attitude toward the potential misunderstanding caused by their prior tweet, indicated by their use of "#sarcasm" and emoticon ";-)". However, this attempt at levity might mask genuine concern about being misconstrued.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the statement is sarcastic. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies the previous tweet was not serious and was meant to be humorous. There's also an implication that the addressed individual might interpret it too seriously, hence they might "kill" themselves, used here as hyperbole.

2. **Presuppositions**: It's taken for granted that the individual (@YasminaBen1) might misinterpret or be offended by a prior statement, necessitating the clarification of sarcasm.

3. **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker aims to clarify that their prior message was sarcastic, likely to prevent any negative reaction or misunderstanding. The use of emoticons and hashtags hopes to inject humor and lighten the context. The speaker is addressing @YasminaBen1, warning them about the previous tweet's tone, and indirectly addresses @BalancePhysio, suggesting professional help.

4. **Polarity**: The overall tone involves negative elements due to the phrase "kill yourself," yet it attempts to convey a casual or humorous tone through the inclusion of a wink emoticon.

5. **Pretense**: The speaker maintains a pretense of humor and light-heartedness to potentially defuse tension or misinterpretation. 

6. **Meaning**: Literally, the statement advises @YasminaBen1 to recognize sarcasm in a previous tweet to prevent severe misinterpretation. However, the implied meaning uses sarcasm itself to indicate the previous tweet was not to be taken literally or seriously.

Considering the intent, the use of humor or sarcasm via language indicators (like the emoticon and hashtag), and the inferred warning against misunderstanding, the statement is indeed sarcastic. There's a semblance of concern masked behind attempted humor, aiming to ensure the recipient doesn't take offense or worry unnecessarily.

"#Hazard worker training. 1st break there was 3 doz donuts and half class outside to smoke. #fail #nomealfitters #irony @MealFit @CrossFit"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a mismatch between the purpose of the hazard worker training and the participants' behavior during the break. Offering donuts and having many participants smoking seems counterproductive to the overall goals of health and safety that one might expect from such training.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely finds the situation ironic and perhaps counterintuitive. They may feel that the presence of unhealthy foods and smoking goes against the values of a health-conscious environment, particularly when associated with brands or concepts like @MealFit and @CrossFit, which promote fitness and wellbeing.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the implication of irony and the speaker’s perception of the situation as a "fail" are aligned. Both suggest disapproval or mockery of the incongruity between a health/safety environment and the unhealthy actions observed.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending. Their use of hashtags and mention of irony and fail suggests a genuine critique or humorous sarcasm about the situation they observed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement addresses the irony in a hazard worker training setting where donuts are provided and participants are observed smoking, which seems counterproductive to health and safety goals. The implicit meaning is clear: the speaker finds this situation ironic, highlighting the disconnect between the intended purpose of promoting health and safety and the behavior observed on the break.

**Implicature:**
The situation implies skepticism about health-oriented activities and the commitment of the training environment to its own goals.

**Presuppositions:**
It is taken for granted that hazard worker training should inherently promote health and wellness, usually avoiding unhealthy habits like excessive sugar intake and smoking.

**Speaker's Intent:**
The speaker likely aims to criticize or humorously point out the irony and inconsistency between the training's perceived objectives and the actual behaviors during breaks. The speaker appears to be a casual observer commenting on the incongruity.

**Polarity:**
The tone of the last sentence is negative, evident from the use of hashtags like #fail.

**Pretense:**
There doesn't appear to be pretense in the speaker’s attitude; they seem to genuinely criticize or mock the situation.

**Meaning:**
The literal meaning pertains to the surprising observation at the training break, while the implied meaning critiques the contradiction of unhealthy behavior during a purportedly health-oriented event.

After reviewing this analysis, the statement appears to be sarcastic. The speaker underscores the irony through humorous sarcasm, emphasizing the mismatch between expectations (health consciousness) and reality (unhealthy actions).

The statement is: "@Boeing, @SpaceX told to stop work under crew contracts #irony http://t.co/1Hyb70IATA"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is something unexpected or counterintuitive (ironic) about the situation where Boeing and SpaceX have been told to stop work under their crew contracts.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely finds it surprising or illogical that these prominent aerospace companies, contracted to work on significant spaceflights, are being temporarily halted. The use of the hashtag "#irony" suggests that the situation is contrary to what one would normally expect in such a circumstance.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the speaker implies and thinks similarly about the situation. Both suggest that there is an ironic or paradoxical element involved in the halt of work under these important contracts.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending; instead, they are highlighting the unusual or unexpected nature of the situation with genuine surprise and engagement.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker suggests there's an ironic element in Boeing and SpaceX being told to stop work on crew contracts, highlighting the unexpected nature of the situation given the significance of these companies in space travel. The speaker seems genuinely surprised, with no pretense, as indicated by the use of the hashtag "#irony."

The intent of the speaker is to draw attention to the unexpected development in the aerospace industry, possibly expressing discontent or surprise. The statement has a slightly negative tone as it points out the paradox in the situation.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it's important to assess the hashtag "#irony." In many contexts, when people highlight irony, it can be used sarcastically to indicate skepticism or criticism about the underlying situation. Here, although the speaker genuinely finds the situation ironic, there may also be a layer of sarcasm due to the nature of how contracts typically function with industry leaders like Boeing and SpaceX. 

Therefore, considering the incongruity highlighted by the term irony and the context in which such terms can hint at sarcasm, the statement can be seen as having a sarcastic undertone, as it showcases a seemingly illogical or contradictory industry decision.

Statement to analyze: "What a great Christmas. 😅 #not"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that their Christmas was not great at all. By using the hashtag "not" after the initial statement "What a great Christmas," they indicate sarcasm, suggesting the opposite of what the literal words convey.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely feels disappointed, dissatisfied, or frustrated with how Christmas turned out. The use of an emoji with a sweat-smile (😅) can suggest some attempt at light-heartedness or resignation about the situation, showing a bit of humor or irony on the topic.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they are. Both the implication of sarcasm with the hashtag "not" and the choice of emoji reinforce the speaker's thinking that Christmas wasn't great.

Finally, is the speaker pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation?
The speaker is using sarcasm, so there's an element of pretended positivity in the statement "What a great Christmas," but the overall tone, indicated by the hashtag and emoji, shows a real attitude of dissatisfaction or irony concerning their Christmas experience.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "What a great Christmas. 😅 #not" is a clear example of sarcasm. 

The implicature is the speaker's suggestion that Christmas was the opposite of great, implying it was disappointing or unsatisfactory. The presupposition is that Christmas is generally expected to be a joyous occasion, which in this case was not met. The speaker's intent is likely to express their dissatisfaction humorously, perhaps to elicit empathy or shared understanding from others who might have had a similarly disheartening experience. The use of the hashtag "not" and the sweat-smile emoji both give a negative tone to the final sentence, suggesting disappointment. There is pretense in the speaker's initial positive-sounding statement, which is immediately undermined by the hashtag. The literal meaning of the statement is contradicted by the implied meaning, where the speaker is clearly dissatisfied despite the positive wording. 

The preliminary analysis rightly identifies the sarcasm in the statement, focusing on the elements that reveal the speaker's true feelings contrary to the statement's literal wording. No changes to this analysis are necessary, and the statement is indeed sarcastic.

The speaker says: "Oh Oh mum is #not #going to be #pleased #littletike http://t.co/5Q01FsYjCW"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that something has happened involving a "little tike" that might upset their mother. The hashtags suggest a playful or humorous tone, indicating that whatever transpired might not be particularly severe or consequential, but still noteworthy enough to potentially elicit a disapproving reaction from their mother.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to view the situation with a degree of light-heartedness or amusement. The use of hashtags and the phrase "Oh Oh" typically express a playful acknowledgment of impending trouble, but it doesn't seem to be a grave concern. This suggests that the speaker is not worried about the mother's reaction but finds the scenario amusing enough to share.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both imply and express a playful acknowledgment that the mother will react negatively, but it is not something to be seriously concerned about. The speaker finds humor or mild amusement in the potential for a negative reaction, implying it is part of normal interactions rather than a serious issue.

It doesn't seem that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their tone appears to be genuinely playful, indicating that they likely find the humor in the situation rather than masking a different, less light-hearted sentiment.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Oh Oh mum is #not #going to be #pleased #littletike" suggests that something noteworthy has happened, which might lead to the mother being displeased. However, the use of hashtags and the phrase "Oh Oh" create a playful tone, implying that the situation is not severe. There is an understanding that the mother's reaction will be negative, but it's approached with humor and amusement by the speaker. The speaker does not seem to be pretending and genuinely views the situation with light-heartedness.

To determine if the statement is sarcastic, consider the following:
- **The Implicature**: The speaker implies an amusing or minor mishap involving a "little tike," expecting displeasure from the mother but finding it funny or trivial.
- **The Presuppositions**: It is assumed that whatever happened is typical of interactions with a young child ("little tike") and not seriously worrisome.
- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to share a humorous moment or a small potential issue with amusement and to entertain or inform others.
- **Polarity**: The tone is light, implying negative potential reaction, but presented positively with humor.
- **Pretense**: There's no pretense; the speaker's playful attitude seems genuine.
- **Meaning**: Literally, the mother won't be pleased, but implied meaning adds humor and triviality to the situation.

Reflecting on this analysis, the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker expresses genuine amusement and doesn't mask their intent with implicit sarcasm.

"Waking up with your cat attacking your hand is always delightful..... #not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that waking up to their cat attacking their hand is not delightful at all, contrary to the sarcastic way they stated it.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is likely frustrated or annoyed by the situation and does not find it enjoyable.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are the same. Through sarcasm, they express the opposite of their true feelings, which is that the situation is not delightful.

The speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation, as they use sarcasm to suggest fake delight while actually expressing displeasure or annoyance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
- **Implicature**: The speaker's statement implies dissatisfaction. By stating it's "always delightful" paired with "#not," they are communicating the opposite of delight, indicating irritation or annoyance.

- **Presuppositions**: The speaker takes for granted that most people would not find their hand being attacked by a cat delightful, suggesting a shared understanding that this is typically a bothersome experience.

- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker intends to express their annoyance or frustration with the situation. They use sarcasm to humorously convey their irritation and possibly to entertain or relate to others who have had similar experiences. The speaker appears to be an individual who owns a cat and is speaking to a general audience who might relate to or find humor in the situation.

- **Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence, utilizing "#not," is negative, indicating displeasure despite the use of the word "delightful."

- **Pretense**: There is pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they pretend to find the situation delightful while actually feeling the opposite.

- **Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests that being attacked by the cat is delightful, but the implied meaning, clarified by the use of sarcasm and "#not," reveals that it is not delightful at all, but rather annoying or frustrating.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the analysis is accurate in identifying the sarcasm. The statement is indeed sarcastic, as it uses irony to express an emotion contrary to the literal statement, conveying displeasure in a humorous way.

"Hoar frost is challenging for some to spell."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the term "hoar frost" is not commonly spelled correctly by some people, likely due to its unconventional spelling or unfamiliarity.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely finds the situation amusing or noteworthy enough to mention, suggesting they are aware of the difficulty or irregularity involved in spelling "hoar frost." They might also think it is a common enough issue to point out.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the thought center around the difficulty that some people experience in spelling "hoar frost."

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature:** The speaker suggests that "hoar frost" is a term that some people struggle to spell. This implies that it's less familiar or has a unique spelling that catches people off guard.

**Presuppositions:** The speaker assumes that spelling "hoar frost" is a known challenge, and people reading the statement are aware of what "hoar frost" is.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The intent might be to highlight a common spelling error, possibly with a hint of amusement. The speaker is possibly aiming to share a light-hearted observation with others who might find it relatable or amusing.

**Polarity:** The statement carries a neutral or mildly negative tone, as it highlights a challenge or difficulty.

**Pretense:** There doesn't appear to be pretense in the speaker's attitude. The statement seems genuine without underlying sarcasm or irony.

**Meaning:** The literal meaning is that "hoar frost" is challenging to spell for some people. The implied meaning is that it's an interesting or amusing observation about the English language.

"Speed cameras in Whipton by village shops. & yes it Takes 5 police officers!! 🚔 #waste #of #money #does #not #take #five #individuals 😂🚨🚓"

- The speaker implies that it is unnecessary and excessive to have five police officers handling a speed camera in Whipton by the village shops.
- The speaker likely thinks that this allocation of resources (five police officers for speed cameras) is inefficient and a waste of money.
- Yes, what the speaker implies (that it's unnecessary and excessive) aligns with what they think (that it's a waste of money and resources).
- The speaker's use of hashtags and emojis suggests a mocking or sarcastic attitude, indicating that they are not pretending and genuinely find the situation ridiculous.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement implies that assigning five police officers to manage a speed camera by the village shops in Whipton is excessive and inefficient. The speaker presupposes that the task of handling speed cameras does not require such a large police presence, and they hope to express their criticism of this allocation of resources. The tone is negative, reflecting disapproval, and there is a humorous pretense in the speaker's attitude, as indicated by the use of hashtags like #waste #of #money and laughing emojis. The literal meaning recounts the situation of speed cameras and the number of officers present, while the implied meaning criticizes the inefficiency and mockery of resource allocation.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it accurately identifies the sarcasm present in the speaker's statement. The use of exaggerated descriptions and humor clearly indicates that the speaker is being sarcastic and critical of the situation. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

The speaker states: "No one talks like I do, No one thinks like I do, No moves like I do #ConorMcgregor #Ufc #Quotes."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they possess a unique and unmatched individuality, suggesting that no one else can replicate their manner of speech, thought process, or movement. By including hashtags like #ConorMcgregor and #Ufc, the speaker might be drawing a parallel between themselves and the UFC fighter Conor McGregor, who is known for his distinct personality and style in the mixed martial arts world.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to have a high level of self-confidence and perhaps admiration for Conor McGregor's distinctive character. They might think that their own uniqueness is worth recognizing or emulating, similar to McGregor's persona.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implied message and the explicit statement indicate that the speaker sees themselves as unique and individualistic, much like how they appear to perceive Conor McGregor.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
It doesn't appear that the speaker is pretending. The statement seems to be an expression of genuine confidence and individuality, possibly reflected through admiration for or alignment with Conor McGregor's public image.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "No one talks like I do, No one thinks like I do, No moves like I do" followed by hashtags referencing Conor McGregor and UFC, suggests a portrayal of unmatched uniqueness akin to the public image of McGregor, known for his distinctiveness in the mixed martial arts arena. The speaker implies that their traits are unique and ideally linked with McGregor’s character, reflecting genuine admiration and self-confidence.

Analysis:

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies self-uniqueness and possibly emulates Conor McGregor's image.
- **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that the listener knows who Conor McGregor is and why he is emblematic of uniqueness.
- **Intent**: The speaker aims to express self-confidence and individuality, potentially drawing a parallel with McGregor.
- **Polarity**: The tone is positive, rooted in self-assurance.
- **Pretense**: There seems to be no pretense; the attitude appears genuine.
- **Meaning**: The literal meaning—claiming unmatched traits—is aligned with the implied meaning of unique individuality and confidence influenced by McGregor's public image.

Reflection:
The preliminary analysis is correct in identifying the speaker’s intent and emotional authenticity. There is no indication of sarcasm, as the expression of individuality and self-confidence appears earnest rather than mocking or disingenuous. The statement is not sarcastic.

The speaker states: "I need to get out of this car before I kill my dad."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are in a highly frustrating or contentious situation with their dad inside the car. The use of the phrase "before I kill my dad" suggests they feel overwhelmed by anger or frustration in the moment.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that the situation is tense and likely volatile. They may believe that leaving the situation (getting out of the car) is necessary to prevent this frustration from escalating further.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think appear to align. They both convey a sense that the situation is potentially explosive and that distance or removal from the situation might be necessary to prevent any further escalation.

Pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation:
The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have an attitude. Their statement appears to be an expression of genuine frustration or anger, albeit hyperbolically expressed as "kill my dad," which indicates the level of emotion involved. The speaker seems to be venting rather than performing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement, "I need to get out of this car before I kill my dad," implies that the speaker is experiencing intense frustration or anger towards their dad during a car ride. The presupposition is that the situation inside the car is tense, potentially leading to further conflict if the speaker remains. The speaker's intent appears to be to communicate their high level of stress and need to distance themselves as a precautionary measure.

The polarity of the last sentence is negative, as it suggests extreme frustration or anger. There is no pretense detected; the speaker is not pretending but rather genuinely expressing their emotions. The literal meaning involves a hyperbolic expression of wanting to prevent conflict, while the implied meaning highlights a pressing need to de-escalate tension by removing themselves from the situation.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the hyperbolic nature of "kill my dad" indicates a sarcastic tone intended to exaggerate the frustration for dramatic effect. Therefore, the statement can be considered sarcastic, as it uses exaggeration to highlight the intensity of the situation without any actual violent intent.

The statement is: "#Sarcasm makes you mentally stronger. Which is very effective when dealing with emotional #stress and #fustration.|#funfact #WhatIfISay"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that sarcasm has a beneficial effect on mental strength and can be an effective tool in managing emotional stress and frustration.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely has a somewhat humorous or ironic perspective on the use of sarcasm, possibly viewing it as a useful mechanism for coping with negative emotions, though they might not be entirely serious about its effectiveness.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Not exactly. While the implication is that sarcasm is genuinely effective for mental strength and dealing with stress, the inclusion of hashtags like #funfact and #WhatIfISay suggests that the speaker might be using sarcasm themselves, indicating they might find the idea a bit humorous or not entirely credible.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is likely using a sarcastic tone when suggesting that sarcasm makes one mentally stronger, thus pretending to endorse this idea with seriousness when in fact they approach it with humor or irony.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement implies that sarcasm might help build mental strength and effectively cope with stress and frustration. The speaker, however, likely has a humorous or ironic view of using sarcasm in this way. The speaker's implication and actual thoughts diverge: while ostensibly presenting sarcasm as beneficial, the hashtags (#funfact and #WhatIfISay) indicate a playful or mocking tone, undermining the seriousness of the claim.

Analyzing further:
- Implicature: Sarcasm is humorously touted as a tool for mental resilience.
- Presuppositions: It assumes that sarcasm can indeed impact mental strength and emotional management.
- Intent: The speaker likely intends to amuse or provoke thought by presenting an ironic twist on the idea of sarcasm as a coping mechanism.

Polarity, pretense, and meaning suggest:
- Polarity: Although seemingly positive, the underlying tone is likely negative or ironic.
- Pretense: The speaker might be pretending to seriously endorse sarcasm's benefits.
- Meaning: The literal statement endorses sarcasm seriously, whereas the implied meaning is more playful or skeptical.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic, using humor to question the effectiveness of sarcasm in dealing with emotions.

The statement is: "Work hard in silence; let success make the noise."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that one should focus on their work diligently and without seeking attention or validation from others. The success that results from hard work will naturally draw attention and recognition on its own without needing to boast about efforts during the process.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker believes that hard work is most effective and valuable when performed quietly and consistently, and that true success does not require self-promotion. They likely think that success itself is sufficient to speak for the individual's achievements and efforts.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the belief suggest that the focus should be on the work itself, with success being the indicator and communicator of that hard work, rather than talking about the effort put in.

Finally, the speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. They genuinely endorse the importance of modesty in work ethic and letting achievements speak for themselves.

To determine if the statement "Work hard in silence; let success make the noise" is sarcastic, let's analyze the elements:

**The Implicature:** The statement implies that true merit is recognized through results rather than verbal declarations or self-promotion.

**The Presuppositions:** It presupposes that the speaker and the audience value the virtues of hard work, humility, and the idea that results, not words, should speak for themselves.

**The Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker aims to encourage a mentality of quiet diligence and to emphasize that success will naturally lead to recognition. The speaker appears to advocate for a certain work ethic.

**The Polarity:** The tone of the statement is positive and motivational. It promotes a constructive work ethic.

**Pretense:** There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude. The speaker shares a genuine belief in the philosophy of working quietly and letting success be the indicator of effort.

**Meaning:** The literal meaning (to work quietly and let success be evident) aligns with the implied meaning. There is no irony or contradiction present.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it suggests a consistent and sincere endorsement of the value of silent hard work and the power of success to communicate effort. Since there is no indication of irony, contradiction, or mockery, the statement is not sarcastic.

"My favorite thing is waking up at 4 and driving 20 minutes in the snow just to see this bitch ass #Not #PaneraProTeam http://t.co/qebtDSVoRT"

- The speaker implies that they do not enjoy waking up at 4 AM and driving in the snow for 20 minutes to deal with something or someone at Panera, which they find unpleasant or annoying, as indicated by "this bitch ass."
- The speaker clearly has a negative opinion about the situation, as evidenced by the sarcastic statement prefacing their grievances and the use of dismissive language.
- Yes, the speaker's implication and thoughts are aligned; both relaying dissatisfaction and sarcasm towards having to experience an inconvenience involving Panera.
- The speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude ("My favorite thing...") to emphasize their disdain through sarcasm, showing that they actually feel quite the opposite about the task.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement, "My favorite thing is waking up at 4 and driving 20 minutes in the snow just to see this bitch ass #Not #PaneraProTeam," is sarcastic. The implicature is that the speaker does not actually enjoy these activities, despite claiming it as their favorite thing. The presuppositions are that waking up early and driving in the snow are inconvenient and unpleasant, and that the speaker's experience at Panera or with someone at Panera is negative. The speaker's intent is to express their dissatisfaction and frustration with the situation, using sarcasm to emphasize their negative feelings. The tone of the statement is negative, with dismissive and derogatory language such as "bitch ass" indicating a lack of genuine affection or enthusiasm for the scenario. There is clear pretense in the speaker's attitude, pretending to have a positive stance to highlight their true discontent. The difference between the literal and implied meaning reveals that the speaker is not expressing enjoyment, but rather criticism of the circumstances they are describing. The preliminary analysis accurately identifies the sarcasm and should remain unchanged.

The statement is a string of hashtags and emoji symbols suggesting that people's reactions and recognition of others fluctuate with the presence or absence of money. 

- The speaker implies that people's reactions, recognition, and perhaps even moral or religious acknowledgment change based on the presence of money.
- The speaker seems to think that without money, there is a lack of positive emotions, recognition, or acknowledgment, potentially highlighting a superficial or materialistic societal flaw.
- Yes, both the implication and the speaker’s thought suggest a cynicism towards how money influences human behavior and relationships.

The speaker appears to be critiquing societal attitudes and perhaps expressing some cynicism or disappointment, rather than pretending to have a different attitude toward the conversation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Implicature: The statement implies that human behaviors and respect fluctuate significantly with financial status, suggesting that recognition and positive emotions are tied closely to material wealth.

Presuppositions: It presupposes that society inherently values individuals differently based on their financial standing and that morals or religious values might also skew due to monetary influence.

Intent of the speaker: The speaker aims to criticize societal attitudes by highlighting the inconsistent treatment of people based on money, pointing out perceived flaws in human behavior and moral values.

Polarity: The tone of the statement is negative, as it focuses on the negative aspects of human relationships and recognition tied to money.

Pretense: There appears to be no pretense; the speaker's attitude is straightforwardly critical about the issue.

Meaning: Literally, the statement describes behaviors and recognition linked to financial status with a string of hashtags and emojis. Implied is a criticism of society's superficial valuation of people based on money, suggesting a moral or ethical critique.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the speaker uses sarcastic undertones to highlight and criticize the disparity in treatment based on financial status. Given the cynicism and critical tone in the expression regarding societal values, the statement is sarcastic.

The feeling you get, when you just wanna flip the table and screw the finals.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, or fed up with the stress and pressure associated with finals.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that the finals are causing them significant stress and possibly frustration, to the point where they are considering a dramatic or impulsive action, such as "flipping the table," as a way to express their feelings.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both imply a negative sentiment towards finals, pointing to high levels of stress and frustration.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending; their statement appears to be a genuine expression of their current emotional state regarding the finals.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement expresses the speaker's overwhelming frustration with their finals, using the metaphor "flip the table" to convey a desire for dramatic release from stress. The analysis suggests that this indicates a negative sentiment and high stress levels related to finals. There is no indication of pretense; the speaker seems to sincerely express their emotional distress.

To determine if the statement is sarcastic, we should examine the following:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies significant frustration and stress about the finals, suggesting a wish to escape or vent these emotions dramatically.

2. **Presuppositions**: It's presupposed that the finals are extremely stressful and frustrating for the speaker.

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The intent is likely to communicate their frustration and possibly seek empathy or resonance with others experiencing the same stress.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the statement is negative due to the expressed frustration and desire to "screw the finals."

5. **Pretense**: There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are authentic in sharing their frustration.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning involves actually flipping a table, which is impractical, but the implied meaning is an expression of wanting to escape the stress of finals.

Considering the above analysis, the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker genuinely articulates their frustration with finals without the typical traits of sarcasm, such as a contrast between literal and intended meanings or an underlying mockery of the situation. The preliminary analysis rightly captures the genuine nature of the speaker's expression, and no changes are necessary.

The statement is: "So much #sarcasm at work mate 10/10 #boring 100% #dead mate full on #shit absolutely #sleeping mate can't handle the #sarcasm"

- The speaker implies that there is excessive sarcasm at their workplace, and they find it boring, dead, and uninteresting, to the extent that it makes them feel sleepy and unable to cope with it.
- The speaker thinks negatively about the situation, expressing dissatisfaction and frustration with the sarcasm at work.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are saying the same thing. Both reflect discontent and tiredness with the sarcastic environment at work.
- The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude and seems to be genuinely expressing their frustration and boredom with the sarcasm at work.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature:** The speaker implies that the sarcasm at work is overwhelming and not amusing, contrary to its usual purpose of being humorous or witty.

**Presuppositions:** The speaker presupposes that sarcasm is typically meant to be entertaining or engaging, but their experience at work does not fulfill this expectation.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker intends to express their frustration and discontent with the sarcastic atmosphere at their workplace. The use of "mate" suggests a conversational tone, possibly directed to peers who can relate to the situation.

**Polarity:** The tone in the last sentence is negative.

**Pretense:** There is no pretense. The speaker is genuinely expressing disdain for the sarcastic environment.

**Meaning:** While the literal meaning talks about sarcasm, boredom, and sleepiness, the implied meaning is that the speaker finds the sarcastic environment tiresome and unentertaining, contradicting the purpose of sarcasm.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The exaggerated descriptors like "10/10 #boring" and "100% #dead" highlight an ironic stance, indicating that the speaker does not genuinely believe sarcasm is boring but is using sarcasm to emphasize their frustration with the situation. Therefore, the preliminary analysis is correct but can be expanded to highlight the ironic use of sarcasm to express sarcasm fatigue.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they feel overwhelmed or exasperated with the amount of orthodontist appointments they have. They seem to be jokingly suggesting that the frequency or demands of these appointments are somewhat excessive. 

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that the situation is somewhat out of the ordinary, as denoted by their use of humor and exaggeration. They may not necessarily be distressed, but they are expressing a playful frustration or disbelief at having to deal with it.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. They are using humor to express a mild frustration or incredulity toward the situation with the orthodontist appointments.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is not necessarily pretending but is choosing to express their feelings about the situation through humor. It suggests that while they might indeed find the situation somewhat absurd or annoying, they are not gravely upset about it, opting instead for a light-hearted posture.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Preliminary Analysis Summary:**

The statement by the speaker uses humor and exaggeration to convey a sense of mild frustration or incredulity regarding the frequent orthodontist appointments. The speaker's tone is light-hearted and playful, indicating that the situation is perceived as somewhat excessive but not seriously distressing. Through the use of hashtags and the phrase "bitches be like," they humorously express a feeling of being overwhelmed, while not being gravely upset.

**Analysis for Sarcasm:**

- **Implicature:** The speaker implies they have too many orthodontist appointments, expressing it through humor.
- **Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that frequent orthodontist appointments are excessive or tiring.
- **Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker aims to express exasperation humorously to their followers or friends.
- **Polarity:** The tone of the last sentence is negative, suggesting discomfort with the situation.
- **Pretense:** The attitude is genuine, as the humor reflects actual feelings of being overwhelmed, without an insincere or artificial tone.
- **Meaning:** The literal request for appointments contrasts with the implied sentiment that the appointments are too frequent.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement does not fully embody sarcasm as it lacks the key elements of insincerity and pretense often found in sarcastic comments. The use of humor softens the tone and does not convey disdain or contempt, which are typical in sarcasm. Thus, the statement is not sarcastic—it's a humorous expression of mild frustration.

The statement is, "Tag a teammate who is so bad, he runs the line every week. http://t.co/FCMmmF4h3h I'm sorry to say it's @sam__clough."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a teammate, specifically Sam Clough, who is consistently performing poorly enough that he is relegated to a lesser role each week, likely indicating a lack of skill or competence in their primary role.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to express a half-joking, half-critical opinion about Sam Clough's performance. By tagging him publicly, the speaker shows a level of familiarity and camaraderie, but also openly criticizes his abilities.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and thinks are aligned; both point to Sam Clough's perceived poor performance. The speaker seems to simultaneously express a light-hearted teasing as well as genuine criticism.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker seems to be using humor as a way to address the situation, which might suggest pretending to be more lighthearted about the criticism than they actually are. However, the humor also indicates a possible attempt to soften the blow of the critique, suggesting a playful camaraderie rather than outright malice.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement in question, "Tag a teammate who is so bad, he runs the line every week. I'm sorry to say it's @sam__clough," carries a humorous undertone despite its critical nature. 

**Implicature:** The statement implies that Sam Clough is frequently assigned to running the line, a task often associated with lesser skill in a sports context, suggesting his underperformance.

**Presuppositions:** It's presumed that running the line is a role for those who are not excelling in their main position, and that Sam Clough frequently finds himself in this situation.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker seems to be engaging in light-hearted banter within the context of a sports team, aiming to tease Sam about his abilities while maintaining a sense of camaraderie.

**Polarity:** The statement has a playful yet negative tone, as it criticizes Sam's performance in a humorous manner.

**Pretense:** There is a pretense of jocular criticism – the speaker uses humor to soften the critique, creating a playful atmosphere rather than outright criticism.

**Meaning:** The literal meaning is a direct critique of Sam's abilities. The implied meaning, however, is a playful jab intended more for humor among teammates than serious criticism.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it accurately captures the dual nature of the statement – blending criticism with humor. Thus, the statement is indeed sarcastic, combining a literal critique with an implied light-heartedness.

The tweet from @ollielocke states: "now, to remember which book... #goodluck"

- The speaker implies that they are trying to recall the title or details of a specific book but are having difficulty doing so. The hashtag #goodluck suggests that this may be a common challenge or a light-hearted one.
- The speaker seems to think that this situation is amusing or mildly frustrating, enough to share it publicly and use a hashtag wishing themselves or others good luck, indicating that they may view it as a trivial or relatable problem.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. They imply a light-hearted difficulty with remembering a book, and their use of the hashtag suggests that they find the challenge somewhat ironic or typical.
- The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude. The tweet's tone and content suggest a genuine, casual approach to the situation, without any hidden intentions or forced attitudes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis examines the statement's implications, presuppositions, speaker intent, polarity, pretense, and meaning:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker is having trouble recalling the details of a specific book, implying a common or relatable struggle with memory.
2. **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that forgetting book details is a shared experience and perhaps not one warranting worry.
3. **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker hopes to communicate a humorous or light-hearted experience, inviting others to relate to it. The speaker is likely experiencing a mild frustration and uses this platform to express it in a humorous way.
4. **Polarity**: The tone is neutral to positive, given the light-hearted nature implied by the hashtag #goodluck.
5. **Pretense**: There is no evident pretense; the speaker seems genuinely amused by their own forgetfulness.

**Meaning**: The literal meaning involves the speaker needing to recall a book, while the implied meaning suggests the humorous difficulty of this mundane task, made evident by the hashtag.

Reflecting on the analysis, the initial assessment aligns well with the evident intent and tone. However, considering the use of the phrase "good luck," there may be a hint of sarcasm due to the irony of the situation being humorous. The statement is mildly sarcastic, as the speaker humorously wishes themselves luck on a trivial issue.

The statement is: "I like the feeling when people thinks they're 2 steps ahead of me... But the truth is they're miles and miles behind me AHAHAHAHA |#sarcasm"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is a perception by others that they are more advanced or ahead in some context, but the reality is quite the opposite. The speaker feels that they are actually much further ahead than these people assume.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker appears to take amusement and perhaps confidence from the fact that people mistakenly believe they are ahead, while actually being much further behind. They enjoy the misconception and possibly feel superior in this scenario.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks is consistent. Both suggest the speaker believes they are much more advanced than others perceive.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is likely using sarcasm, as indicated by the hashtag, which emphasizes a playful and somewhat mocking tone toward the situation. They don't genuinely enjoy others' misconceptions out of goodwill but rather out of a sense of superiority or humor.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis of the statement identifies the speaker's intent to convey a sense of superiority and amusement over a misconception held by others that they are ahead. The implication is that others are deluded in believing they are ahead, whereas the speaker considers themselves to be far more advanced. The speaker indirectly highlights the disparity between the perceived and actual reality, thus mocking those who misjudge the situation. The statement reflects an implied confidence and a playful, mocking tone, especially emphasized by the use of the hashtag "#sarcasm" and the laughter "AHAHAHAHA," which suggests a sarcastic intent. 

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies that people who think they are ahead are actually far behind.
- **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that there are others who believe they are ahead of the speaker.
- **Intent of the speaker**: The speaker aims to express superiority and humor at the expense of those who underestimate them.
- **Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence is positive for the speaker but negative toward the others being referenced.
- **Pretense**: There is a pretense of enjoyment and amusement in the speaker's attitude.
- **Meaning**: The literal meaning is a reaction to a mistaken belief, while the implied meaning is that the speaker is well ahead and finds the situation laughable.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic, as the use of "#sarcasm" signals, it along with the mock-laughter, indicates a deliberate contrast between a literal interpretation and the speaker's true intent. The analysis aligns with the identification of sarcasm in the statement.

"Remember that one time I worked both jobs while sick and it didnt suck at all... #sarcasm #notworthit"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that working both jobs while sick was a terrible experience and certainly not enjoyable or easy, contrary to what the literal words suggest.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks very negatively about the situation; they likely regret having worked while sick and find it not worthwhile. 

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies through sarcasm and what they actually think indicate the experience was unpleasant and not worth it.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is using sarcasm to pretend as if working while sick wasn't a problem, whereas in reality, they believe it was a negative and regrettable situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker is using sarcasm to convey their negative experience of working both jobs while sick. The statement's literal meaning suggests a positive experience, but the sarcasm, emphasized by hashtags, implies the opposite - that the experience was terrible and not enjoyable. The speaker is expressing regret and frustration about having worked while sick, and the overall tone of the statement is negative.

"HAHAHAHA!! Oops.......I'm addicted to @OneMoreJoke Tweets sooo FUNNY! You Got to follow him for #HILARIOUS #SARCASM #tweets #RT."

- The speaker implies that they find @OneMoreJoke's tweets very amusing and potentially feel compelled to continuously check them, suggesting a sort of playful dependency or addiction to the humor content.
- The speaker seems to genuinely enjoy the tweets, highlighting their humor and sarcasm, and is attempting to share this enthusiasm with others by recommending that they follow @OneMoreJoke.
- Both what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned; they enjoy the humor and sarcasm provided by @OneMoreJoke and find it worthy of a follow and retweet.
- The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude; their statement seems to genuinely express enjoyment and amusement from the content they are recommending.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the speaker genuinely enjoys and finds humor in @OneMoreJoke's tweets. The implied meaning is that @OneMoreJoke's tweets are so amusing that they create a playful "addiction," indicating strong entertainment value. The presupposition is that others may also find these tweets equally hilarious. The intent of the speaker is to promote @OneMoreJoke by encouraging others to follow and retweet their content. The polarity is positive, as the speaker expresses enthusiasm and amusement. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they appear sincerely entertained.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, nothing significant needs to change. The initial analysis correctly identifies a genuine endorsement without sarcasm. Thus, the statement is not sarcastic.

The tweet reads: "hahaha yeah I think so too cause you know how she loves her with all her heart 😂😂😂.... #NOT 🔫."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is sarcastically responding to someone else's comment about a person (presumably a female) who supposedly loves someone else with all her heart. The speaker uses the hashtag #NOT, indicating that they do not actually believe that the person loves the other individual sincerely.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that the notion or statement that "she loves her with all her heart" is false or exaggerated. They clearly express disbelief or doubt about the sincerity or depth of this love.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. Through sarcasm and the use of #NOT, the speaker clearly communicates their belief in the insincerity of the love being discussed.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is not pretending to have an attitude; rather, they employ sarcasm to express their true disbelief or skepticism regarding the claim of love. The laughter ("hahaha") and emojis further emphasize the mockery and non-serious attitude towards the existing statement.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The tweet suggests sarcasm about a statement concerning someone's deep love. The speaker heavily implies disbelief in the notion that the person loves someone "with all her heart," using the hashtag #NOT to clearly express doubt and sarcasm. The statement assumes that the audience understands the disbelief—the sarcastic tone, laughter, and emojis reinforce this. The speaker intends to communicate skepticism and possibly mock the sincerity of the love being discussed.

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies disbelief in the claim of genuine love.
2. **Presuppositions**: The audience is expected to understand the exaggerated notion of love in question.
3. **Intent**: The speaker aims to mock or undermine the credibility of the love being discussed. They are speaking directly to listeners who understand the underlying doubt.
4. **Polarity**: The tone of the statement is negative, with a focus on disbelief and sarcasm.
5. **Pretense**: The speaker does not pretend to agree with the statement; instead, they convey skepticism through sarcasm.
6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests agreement; however, the implied meaning conveys disbelief and mocks the love's sincerity due to the sarcastic tone and the context provided by #NOT.

The preliminary analysis accurately concludes that the statement is sarcastic. The tweet effectively uses humor and sarcasm to express doubt and disbelief regarding the notion of sincere love. The analysis correctly identifies the sarcastic nature and intent of the tweet.

"Thanks GORI-san|#djgori #not for sale http://t.co/g09TZY3oHO"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?  
The speaker is expressing gratitude towards a person or entity referred to as "GORI-san" and is associating this gratitude with a hashtag "#djgori," which likely refers to a DJ or music-related context. By adding "#not for sale," the speaker implies that whatever GORI-san has done or provided is valuable or treasured and is not available for purchase, perhaps indicating it is a personal or exclusive gift or experience.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?  
The speaker likely appreciates whatever GORI-san has done and believes it to be special or of considerable value, given their use of the phrase "not for sale." This suggests a sense of exclusivity or personal importance.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?  
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts suggest that they hold whatever GORI-san has provided in high regard and consider it special or exclusive.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.  
There is no obvious indication that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude. Their use of "thanks," followed by the additional context provided by the hashtags, suggests a genuine expression of gratitude and acknowledgment of the value they perceive in the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To determine if the statement is sarcastic, let's analyze it using the outlined criteria:

The Implicature: The speaker is implying gratitude towards "GORI-san," presumably a DJ or something or someone associated with music memorabilia. By using "#not for sale," they imply that the item or experience is of special value and not available for general purchase, signifying exclusivity.

The Presuppositions: It is taken for granted that the recipient, "GORI-san," has indeed provided something special or significant to the speaker. There's a presumption that both the speaker and potential readers recognize the value of what is being referred to.

The Intent: The speaker seems to express genuine gratitude and perhaps to highlight the value or uniqueness of what "GORI-san" has contributed. Additionally, the intent might include promoting or praising "GORI-san" through association with the hashtags.

Polarity: The tone of the last sentence is positive, given the expression of gratitude and the implication of value.

Pretense: There is no evident pretense. The gratitude and the value expressed appear to be sincere.

Meaning: The literal meaning thanks GORI-san and indicates something is not for sale, possibly a figurine, track, or artwork. The implied meaning conveys that the item or experience is cherished and exclusive.

Reflecting on this analysis, the initial consideration that the speaker is genuine seems accurate. There is no sarcasm detected as the speaker's words align with their apparent intentions, implying gratitude and value without a hint of irony. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

The statement is: "rollins was so pissed off haha."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that someone named Rollins was very angry or upset in a particular situation, and they found this reaction noteworthy or entertaining enough to comment on.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The use of "haha" suggests that the speaker finds Rollins' anger amusing or humorous rather than serious. This indicates that the speaker does not see the situation as particularly grave or concerning, but rather as something lighthearted or entertaining.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think align in the sense that they are acknowledging Rollins' anger and simultaneously find humor in the situation. The implication is that the anger is worth noting, but the reaction it prompts from the speaker is amusement.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending about their attitude; they genuinely seem to find the situation humorous, as indicated by the casual expression of amusement in "haha."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To analyze the statement "rollins was so pissed off haha," we need to break down the components of sarcasm:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that Rollins was upset in a situation that might be considered trivial, given the laughter at the end.

2. **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that Rollins had a significant enough reaction worth noting, and the audience understands who Rollins is and the context of his anger.

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to convey that Rollins' anger is seen as amusing. They are likely addressing an audience familiar with Rollins and perhaps aware of the context of his anger. The laughter suggests a dismissive or lighthearted view of the situation.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence, with the inclusion of "haha," suggests a positive, light-hearted tone.

5. **Pretense**: There's no significant pretense in the speaker's attitude; the amusement seems genuine.

6. **Meaning**: Literally, the statement talks about Rollins being angry. Implied, it suggests the speaker doesn't take the anger seriously and finds it amusing instead.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the speaker's attitude aligns with their implied message, seeing Rollins' anger as entertaining. There's no substantial indication of sarcasm here; the speaker genuinely seems to find the situation funny without any underlying snide remark.

Thus, the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker is expressing genuine amusement at Rollins' reaction rather than pretending to be amused while having a different underlying emotion or message.

The statement is: "Really loves dentist appointments. #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

Yes, the speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude toward dentist appointments, but the sarcasm reveals their true negative feelings.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis suggests that the speaker uses sarcasm to convey their dislike for dentist appointments, contradicting the literal positive sentiment. The use of the hashtag "#sarcasm" explicitly indicates that the true intent is the opposite of what is stated. The implicature is that dentist appointments are not enjoyable. The presupposition is that dentist appointments are generally considered unpleasant. The speaker intends to humorously express their negative feelings about going to the dentist, expecting the audience to understand the sarcasm. The polarity of the statement is negative despite its literal positive tone.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement, "I blame my mom. Mother of the Year #sarcasm," is analyzed as follows:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that their mom is responsible for something negative or undesirable, and the sarcastic use of "Mother of the Year" further suggests that her actions are not praiseworthy.

The statement is: ".@ibnlive is the first to cut to ads during primetime to proudly announce that they're 'putting journalism first'. #Irony #NLprimetime".

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is an inherent contradiction or hypocrisy in IBNLive's actions. By highlighting that the network cuts to ads during primetime while claiming to prioritize journalism, the speaker suggests that the network is not genuinely putting journalism first. Instead, it appears that commercial interests are being prioritized, as implied by the focus on ads.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to view the situation as ironic and potentially deceptive. The use of the hashtag #Irony indicates that the speaker finds it contradictory that a network would interrupt important airtime with advertisements while simultaneously claiming to prioritize journalism. The speaker likely believes that this behavior undermines the network's stated commitment to journalism.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks align in their critique of IBNLive's actions. Both perspectives highlight the perceived contradiction between the network’s claims of prioritizing journalism and its actions during primetime.

- Is the speaker pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation?
  The speaker does not appear to be pretending; instead, they seem genuinely critical of IBNLive's actions. The use of #Irony suggests that the speaker is calling out what they see as a lack of sincerity or honesty in the network's proclaimed priorities.

Both the implication and the explicit expression are aligned in critiquing IBNLive’s actions as undermining their commitment to journalism. The speaker does not appear to be feigning their attitude; rather, they genuinely find the situation contradictory.

"Definitely not...racism is systematic and entrenched in every American institution...also in black/white binary construction."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that racism is deeply rooted and pervasive across all American institutions. They suggest that it's not just a surface-level or isolated issue, but rather an embedded part of societal structures. They also imply the existence of a binary framework in racial discussions, primarily between black and white people, which likely overlooks the complexities and diversity of racial experiences.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are consistent. Both point to a belief in the depth, permanence, and universality of institutional racism in America, as well as the limitations of viewing racial issues through a black/white binary.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
There is no indication that the speaker is pretending or adopting an insincere attitude. Their statement seems direct and reflects a genuine perspective on the entrenched nature of racism in American institutions.

The analysis suggests that the speaker genuinely believes in the complexity and depth of racial issues and is calling for acknowledgement and action to address these structural problems. The intent is to raise awareness and challenge simplistic racial narratives.

In terms of sarcasm:

- What does the speaker think about the situation?

**Preliminary Analysis Summary:**

The speaker, responding to a statement by Holly Manthei, implies skepticism or disbelief about something that was said by remarking "no one really says that." This implies that the speaker finds the statement uncommon or unrepresentative of typical expressions. The speaker's intention is likely to question the validity or commonality of Holly's statement, emphasizing it is not widely held or expressed. The tone of the statement is negative, showing disbelief or skepticism. There seems to be no pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they straightforwardly express doubt without any apparent sarcasm. The literal meaning matches the implied meaning closely because the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the statement’s common usage.

**Reflection:**

Upon reviewing the analysis, the tone of the statement is more of genuine skepticism rather than sarcasm.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the bet is highly unlikely to be accepted by someone else. They suggest that the bet is either ridiculously one-sided or that the outcome of the bet is almost certain, making it difficult for anyone to be convinced to take the opposing position.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that the bet is not feasible or reasonable, and is probably a no-brainer, to the point of being humorous. They might find the situation to be amusing or absurd, as indicated by their use of "LOL."

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think align with the idea that the bet is seen as lopsided or implausible, and possibly humorous due to its nature.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude; their use of informal language ("good luck," "LOL") suggests a genuine and lighthearted reaction to the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis highlights that the speaker's statement implies the bet mentioned is unlikely to be accepted because it's either too one-sided or has an almost certain outcome. This makes the situation humorous or absurd for the speaker, expressed through their informal and light-hearted language with “LOL.” The speaker genuinely finds the situation amusing and is not pretending with their attitude.

### Decision on Sarcasm:

- **Implicature**: The bet is improbable to have any takers, suggesting it is clearly one-sided or certain.
- **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that an opposing side would require someone willing and that this is unlikely.
- **Intent**: The speaker aims to humorously highlight the improbability of finding someone willing to take the bet, likely directed at the account @orion99da.
- **Polarity**: The tone is humorously negative because it points out the bet's impracticality.
- **Pretense**: There is no pretense; the speaker appears genuinely amused.
- **Meaning**: Literally, the speaker wishes luck in finding an opposing bet, but the implication is that such a task is almost impossible, hence funny.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement is sarcastic because the speaker knowingly exaggerates the likelihood of finding someone to take the bet, using this exaggeration humorously to emphasize its improbability. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

The statement is: "@HayekandHockey Yeah someone with Hayek and hockey in their name calling someone racist #irony @Txrebel05"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a contradiction or hypocrisy in the person with the Twitter handle "@HayekandHockey" calling someone else racist. This implication is built on the assumption that there is something inherently ironic or contradictory about someone interested in Hayek and hockey engaging in such accusations.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to find it ironic or amusing that someone using a name associated with certain ideologies (possibly referring to Friedrich Hayek, known for economic liberalism, and the sport of hockey) would be involved in accusations of racism. The use of "#irony" suggests they find the situation humorous or ridiculous, possibly believing that people with such interests typically do not engage in discussions about racism or should not be the ones making such assertions.
 
-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are aligned. Both focus on the perceived irony and contradiction in the situation of "@HayekandHockey" calling someone racist. The implication of irony is inherent in the statement, and the speaker's reaction suggests they perceive the situation as unexpected or incongruous.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending; they appear to genuinely find the situation ironic or amusing. Their use of sarcasm and the hashtag "#irony" likely conveys their authentic reaction to what they perceive as a contradiction.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement on Twitter is examined for its sarcasm. The speaker implicitly criticizes a Twitter user with the handle "@HayekandHockey" by pointing out what they see as an irony or contradiction in that user calling someone else racist. The speaker presupposes that someone aligned with figures like Hayek (referring to Friedrich Hayek, associated with economic liberalism) or hockey, might not align with accusations of racism, or that their doing so seems contradictory or unexpected. The speaker uses a sarcastic tone, indicated by the hashtag "#irony," suggesting they find the situation absurd or amusing. There's no pretense in the speaker's attitude as they straightforwardly express this ironic view.

In terms of tone, the polarity is negative, as it critiques the perceived contradiction. The literal statement merely notes someone calling another person racist, while the implied meaning is that this action is incongruent or hypocritical given the person's interests or persona.

The analysis accurately identifies the sarcasm in the speaker’s statement, highlighting the irony and contradiction pointed out by the speaker. There are no changes needed in the analysis. Thus, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is an expectation or demand for NHS England to release A&E figures during the holiday period. The mention of #Sarcasm and Jeremy Hunt indicates that the speaker may not find the situation satisfactory or genuine, suggesting criticism or skepticism toward Hunt's approach or statement regarding NHS England.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to think that the rationale behind the call to publish A&E figures could be disingenuous or mocking, as indicated by their use of "#Sarcasm." They likely believe that Jeremy Hunt, or possibly those in charge, are being insincere or ironic about their stance on this matter.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's actual thinking point to a criticism of Jeremy Hunt for being insincere regarding the publishing of A&E figures by NHS England. The tweet is a critique of Jeremy Hunt's position, suggesting that he may not truly care about transparency.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

The statement suggests a demand for NHS England to release A&E figures over the holiday period. The use of "#Sarcasm" implies that the speaker is skeptical of Jeremy Hunt's sincerity about this demand. The speaker suggests criticism or skepticism toward Hunt's approach and implies an insincere or ironic stance. Both the implication and the speaker's perspective indicate a critique of Jeremy Hunt, suggesting he may not genuinely care about transparency.

**Analysis:**

- **Implicature**: The statement implies criticism toward Jeremy Hunt and the demand for NHS transparency during a time when it might be less feasible or practical (holiday period).
  
- **Presuppositions**: It's presupposed that Jeremy Hunt has made statements about the NHS needing more transparency, possibly during a time when releasing such data may not be standard practice.

- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to criticize Jeremy Hunt and the unrealistic expectations being presented, questioning the sincerity of his motives. The speaker is an individual or group critical of political figures and their statements, likely a political commentator or advocate for NHS transparency.

- **Polarity**: The tone is negative, as indicated by the use of sarcasm and critique.

- **Pretense**: There is no pretense; the speaker uses sarcasm directly to express disbelief or disagreement with Jeremy Hunt.

- **Meaning**: The literal meaning is a stated agreement with publishing figures, but the implied meaning suggests a lack of sincerity and a critique of Jeremy Hunt's motivations.

In reflection, the preliminary analysis correctly identifies the sarcasm in the statement. The tweet is indeed sarcastic as it uses irony to express skepticism or discontent towards Jeremy Hunt's suggestion or perceived stance on NHS transparency. The statement uses sarcasm to highlight perceived insincerity or unrealistic expectations.

"I do hope you Anti #GamerGate'rs will sleep better, knowing that sabotaging charities would make you more respectable in society. #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that people who oppose GamerGate, referred to as "Anti #GamerGate'rs," are involved in actions that sabotage charities. The speaker suggests that these actions are not actually making these individuals more respectable in society, as they might believe.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is critical and disapproving of what they perceive as the actions of the Anti GamerGate group. By using sarcasm, they are indicating that they believe that sabotage of charities is dishonorable and will not actually lead to increased respect in society.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. The speaker is using sarcasm to criticize the actions of the Anti GamerGate group because they believe that these actions are unethical and counterproductive.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is likely using sarcasm as a rhetorical device, which suggests that they are not genuinely expressing a hopeful attitude. Instead, they are highlighting the perceived hypocrisy or ineffectiveness of the Anti GamerGate group in a critical and disdainful manner.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "I do hope you Anti #GamerGate'rs will sleep better, knowing that sabotaging charities would make you more respectable in society. #sarcasm" employs sarcasm to criticize individuals opposing GamerGate. The implicature is that the Anti GamerGate group participates in unethical activities, specifically the sabotage of charities, which the speaker deems dishonorable and unlikely to enhance their societal respect. The presupposition is that the Anti GamerGate group thinks their actions might be respected. The speaker's intent is to highlight what they perceive as the hypocrisy or ineffectiveness of the Anti GamerGate group using sarcasm. The polarity of the statement is negative, given the use of sarcasm to express disapproval and disdain. The speaker pretends to have the attitude of wanting the group to sleep better, but it's clear this is a facetious claim.

The preliminary analysis identifies the sarcasm consistently through the implicature, presuppositions, and intent of the speaker. The analysis should reflect the speaker's critical stance throughout the statement. The statement is sarcastic, as the literal meaning of hoping for better sleep is countered by the critical and insincere tone indicated through the hashtag "sarcasm."

The tweet says: "@GMA make sure you don't say Christmas!! The decorate for the holiday. #sarcasm #itisachristmastree"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker is implying that "Good Morning America" (GMA), might be avoiding using the word "Christmas" in their coverage or decorations, which they find unnecessary or absurd.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely believes that the situation is silly or over-the-top, suggesting that a Christmas tree should be associated with Christmas, and possibly perceives the avoidance of the term as excessive political correctness.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's opinion indicate that they disagree with minimizing the use of the word "Christmas" in this context.

The speaker is using sarcasm, but they are not pretending to have a different attitude; their sarcastic tone reveals their true view of the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker is using sarcasm to criticize what they perceive as an unnecessary avoidance of using the word "Christmas" by "Good Morning America". They imply that calling it simply "the holiday" instead of Christmas is absurd, given that a Christmas tree is clearly related to Christmas. The speaker's intent is to mock or call out what they see as excessive political correctness. The additional use of hashtags like #sarcasm and #itisachristmastree affirms the speaker's disagreement with the situation. The tone of the statement is negative as they're expressing disdain for the avoidance of the term "Christmas". There is no pretense in their attitude; the sarcasm directly aligns with their actual perspective on the issue.

In summary, the statement is indeed sarcastic, as the speaker uses irony to criticize the situation, highlighting that a tree decorated for holidays is obviously a Christmas tree, hence the concept of not labeling it as such seems unnecessary to them. The preliminary analysis is appropriate and does not require significant changes.

"#Is #There #Too #Much to #Do or #Are #You #Not #Delegating #Enough ? http://t.co/9YaBomBF6c"

- The speaker implies that the feeling of having too much to do may not be due to the actual amount of work, but rather because the individual is not delegating tasks effectively.
- The speaker thinks that people who feel overwhelmed might benefit from evaluating their task management and delegation practices.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are saying the same thing: that effective delegation might be a solution to feeling overwhelmed.

The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; it seems like a straightforward observation encouraging introspection on task management.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the statement questions whether someone is truly overwhelmed by too much work or if they simply aren't delegating tasks efficiently. It implies that the solution to feeling overwhelmed might be better task delegation. The presupposition is that people who feel they have too much to do may not be managing their tasks well. The intent of the speaker seems to be to encourage people to reflect on their delegation practices, likely directed toward individuals who feel overburdened by their workload.

The tone of the last sentence isn't overtly negative or positive. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; it comes across as a genuine suggestion rather than sarcasm. The literal meaning aligns well with the implied message, focusing on the importance of effective delegation.

Reflecting on the analysis, no significant changes are needed. The statement is not sarcastic, as it sincerely suggests that people consider their delegation habits as a potential solution to their workload concerns.

The statement from @tombitt is: "I wonder what % of that 43% agree on what a private cloud is."

- The speaker implies that even though 43% of respondents might have reported using or supporting the use of a private cloud, they might not all have the same understanding of what a private cloud actually is. There is an implication of skepticism about consensus or clear understanding among that percentage.
- The speaker seems to view the situation with a level of doubt or uncertainty regarding the knowledge or agreement among the respondents about the definition or concept of a private cloud.
- What the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are aligned. The skepticism or doubt about the understanding among the respondents is both what is implied by the question and what the speaker likely thinks.
- It does not appear that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude; their question reflects genuine curiosity or skepticism about the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis suggests that the speaker is expressing skepticism about the consistency or clarity of understanding among respondents concerning the concept of a private cloud. The statement implies that of the 43% who reported something related to a private cloud, not all may agree on its definition. The presupposition taken for granted is that there is some level of ambiguity or lack of consensus about what a private cloud actually is. The speaker's intent is to highlight this potential inconsistency or gap in understanding, possibly to provoke further discussion or scrutiny on the matter. The tone of the statement seems neutral with underlying skepticism, without any explicit positive or negative polarity. There is no pretense detected in the speaker's attitude, as the question appears to genuinely reflect doubt or curiosity.

Considering this analysis, the key change would be to identify the level of skepticism and the implicit criticism of the respondents' understanding as subtle sarcasm. While the speaker's literal statement is a question about statistics, the implied meaning reveals doubt about the respondents' knowledge, thus making the statement sarcastic.

- **Statement:** "Tomorrow three test signature.|Thank you. |#school #sarcasm"

- **What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?**
  The speaker implies that they are not genuinely thankful for having three tests the next day. The use of the hashtag "#sarcasm" suggests that the expression of gratitude is not sincere but rather sarcastic.

- **What does the speaker think about the situation?**
  The speaker likely finds the situation of having three tests in one day to be overwhelming or frustrating. Their sarcastic "Thank you" indicates that they are not looking forward to the tests and may feel burdened by them.

- **Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?**
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts align, as both suggest a negative sentiment towards having three tests.

- **Is the speaker pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation?**

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis identifies that the statement "Tomorrow three test signature.|Thank you. |#school #sarcasm" is sarcastic. The key points are:

1. **Implicature:** The speaker implies dissatisfaction with having three tests, despite the superficial "Thank you."

2. **Presuppositions:** It is assumed the tests are a significant and possibly unwelcome commitment to the speaker.

3. **Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker aims to express frustration or annoyance, intending to share this sentiment humorously or dramatically with others who can relate.

4. **Polarity:** Negative, as the expression of gratitude is insincere and meant to highlight the speaker’s displeasure.

5. **Pretense:** The speaker pretends to be thankful, which is contradicted by the use of sarcasm and the hashtag "#sarcasm."

6. **Meaning:** The literal meaning is a polite "Thank you," but the implied meaning, revealed through sarcasm, is frustration.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it accurately captures the speaker's sarcastic tone. There is no need for the preliminary analysis to change, as it correctly identifies the disparity between the literal and implied meanings, confirming the statement is sarcastic.

The statement reads: "Heartless Sanghi #Sarcasm"@Retributions: #IndiawithPakistan because a dumb nation deserves to be taken for a ride again and again. #Lakhvi"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they view supporting or standing with Pakistan in certain situations as unwise or foolish, suggesting a lack of good judgment. The references to "a dumb nation" and being "taken for a ride again and again" imply that India continues to make the same mistakes or falls into the same trap regarding its relations or dealings with Pakistan.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely views the situation negatively. They seem to be expressing frustration or criticism toward actions or policies that align India with Pakistan, as they feel this leads to repeated negative outcomes.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker’s thoughts suggest a critique of the relationship or decisions/actions that lead to India supporting or aligning closely with Pakistan. The use of the hashtag #Lakhvi hints at a specific grievance or historical context related to terrorism or security issues, reinforcing their critical stance.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The tweet is labeled with "#Sarcasm" which suggests that there is a layer of sarcasm in the statement. The speaker likely doesn't sincerely mean that a nation deserves to be "taken for a ride" but uses sarcasm to emphasize their dissatisfaction or disapproval of the perceived naivete or poor decision-making. Therefore, the speaker is pretending to adopt a certain dismissive or contemptuous attitude toward the conversation to emphasize their real critique or frustration.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis indicates that the speaker is using sarcasm to criticize India's relationship or alignment with Pakistan, particularly in the context of terrorism or security, as suggested by the hashtag #Lakhvi. The implication is that aligning with Pakistan is unwise, as it leads to repeated negative outcomes. The speaker expresses frustration through sarcasm, pretending to adopt a dismissive attitude to emphasize their disapproval.

The statement is sarcastic for several reasons:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that continuing to support or align with Pakistan is foolish, though they do not literally believe a nation deserves misfortune.

2. **Presuppositions**: The statement takes for granted that India has been negatively impacted or deceived in its dealings with Pakistan repeatedly.

3. **Intent of the speaker**: The speaker, likely referencing historical grievances like those associated with #Lakhvi, aims to criticize India's policy or decision-making regarding Pakistan.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the statement is negative, as it conveys dissatisfaction and criticism.

5. **Pretense**: The inclusion of "#Sarcasm" and the exaggerated notion of a "dumb nation" being "taken for a ride" indicate pretense in the speaker’s attitude.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning is that a nation deserves misfortune, while the implied meaning is a critique of policy or decision-making and expression of frustration.

The preliminary analysis accurately identifies sarcasm based on the above elements and does not require changes. The statement uses sarcasm to underscore criticism.

  The speaker likely finds the situation unpleasant and frustrating. They had to be in the ER for a long time, which is generally not an enjoyable experience, and their use of sarcasm further communicates their negative feelings.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both imply and reflect dissatisfaction and frustration with having spent a long time in the ER.

Finally, the speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their use of sarcasm (#yay #not) serves to underscore their genuine feeling of annoyance or frustration with the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement, "Been at the ER now since 10... #yay #not," implies dissatisfaction with having to stay at the emergency room for an extended period. The literal meaning may sound neutral, but the use of hashtags creates sarcasm, suggesting a level of frustration or annoyance. The presupposition here is that being in the ER for a long time is generally undesirable. The speaker's intent is to express dissatisfaction, and possibly to garner sympathy or understanding from their audience.

The tone in the final phrase "#yay #not" is negative due to the sarcastic juxtaposition of a normally positive exclamation followed by a negation, further indicating frustration or displeasure. There is no pretense in the speaker’s attitude; they candidly convey their frustrations through sarcasm. The literal statement (being in ER since 10) and the implied meaning (it's unpleasant, emphasized by sarcasm) align as both communicate displeasure.

Reflecting on this analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The sarcastic intent is clear with the use of conflicting hashtags, indicating the speaker expresses a critical or negative view of their experience. No changes are needed in the preliminary analysis.

"Wash hands with water? MOH is rubbing this on everyone's face? #irony http://t.co/sPgfZZIqLO"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that the Ministry of Health (MOH) giving advice to wash hands with water is ironic. They suggest that this advice is either overly simplistic or lacking in substance, considering it as if it's being flaunted to the public as a major directive.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to think that the recommendation to wash hands with water is an obvious or insufficient measure, possibly indicating dissatisfaction or frustration at what they perceive to be a trivial or inadequate response from the MOH.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker’s thoughts convey skepticism or ridicule towards the MOH's advice. The use of the word "irony" suggests they find the situation humorous or absurd.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending. Their tone appears genuinely skeptical or mocking about the MOH’s advice, implying they feel it is not a meaningful contribution to public health guidance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker is sarcastic in their statement about the Ministry of Health's advice to wash hands with water. By suggesting that the MOH is "rubbing this on everyone's face," they imply that the advice is being presented as significant when it is actually seen as simplistic or trivial. The mention of "irony" further highlights their belief that the recommendation is insufficient and perhaps absurd, despite being presented seriously by the MOH. The speaker's intent appears to be to mock or criticize the perceived inadequacy of the MOH's guidance. The tone is negative, showcasing dissatisfaction. Although there is skepticism in the speaker's words, there is no pretense observed, as their tone seems genuinely mocking. The difference between the literal and implied meaning is significant; while the literal meaning is a straightforward recommendation to wash hands, the implied meaning questions its value and mocks its delivery as a public health message. The preliminary analysis correctly identifies the sarcasm present in the statement.

"Laborers in the San Joaquin Valley, one of the most productive farming regions in the world, suffer from food insecurity. #irony #poverty"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies a stark contrast or contradiction between the abundance of food production in the San Joaquin Valley and the food insecurity faced by the very laborers who work there. This irony is underscored by using the word "irony" and the hashtag, which suggests the situation is unjust and shocking.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to think that the situation is deeply unfair and perhaps absurd. They likely believe it is unacceptable that those who contribute to food production are unable to access adequate food themselves. The use of the hashtag "#poverty" suggests they see this as part of a broader systemic issue related to poverty.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. Both suggest a critical view of the situation as being unjust and ironic that those who are instrumental in producing food are suffering from food insecurity.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude. Their use of language indicates genuine criticism and concern regarding the irony and poverty associated with the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement highlights the contradiction that laborers in one of the world's most productive farming regions, the San Joaquin Valley, experience food insecurity.

They view it as an example of broader systemic poverty, indicated by "#poverty." The analysis shows that the speaker genuinely criticizes the situation without pretense.

There is no pretense; the concern appears genuine. The literal statement contrasts the productive nature of the region with the irony of food insecurity.

The speaker states: "Suhs been clean for 2 years and has only been in the league for five don't act like he was dirty for 10 years#not biased my ass"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that Lance Medow, or whoever they are referring to, has been exaggerating or mischaracterizing Suh's on-field behavior by implying that he has been playing dirty for a longer period than he actually has. The speaker suggests that Suh has not been "dirty" for the duration suggested.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that Lance Medow or the person they refer to is being unfairly critical or biased towards Suh by not acknowledging that Suh has changed his behavior in recent years. They think the criticism is outdated or misinformed.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts align in expressing that the criticism of Suh's behavior is exaggerated, outdated, or unfairly persistent nonetheless.

Finally, is the speaker pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation?
No, the speaker seems genuinely frustrated and is expressing their opinion candidly. The use of explicit language and calling out the person by saying "not biased my ass" indicates an authentic reaction rather than a feigned attitude.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature**: The speaker implies that Lance Medow or someone else has been unjustly extending the period during which Suh is considered to have played "dirty." The speaker is contesting this view by presenting a more accurate timeline of Suh's on-field conduct, indicating that Suh has been playing clean for the last two years of his five-year career.

**Presuppositions**: The speaker assumes that the audience is aware of Suh's reputation as a "dirty" player and that there is a conversation or ongoing debate about Suh's conduct. It is also taken for granted that Lance Medow, or whoever they are addressing, has made statements about Suh's behavior.

**Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to challenge and correct what they see as an unfair characterization of Suh by accusing the person they address of bias. The use of the phrase "#not biased my ass" suggests they aim to highlight perceived hypocrisy or exaggeration in the claims made by the addressed party.

**Polarity**: The tone of the last part of the sentence is negative, as evidenced by the dismissive language and the use of a mild expletive. This indicates the speaker's frustration or disagreement.

**Pretense**: There's no pretense in the speaker's attitude. The speaker appears to express genuine frustration.

**Meaning**: The difference between the literal and implied meaning is that, while literally, the statement lists facts about Suh's career, the implied meaning criticizes the addressed party for their alleged misrepresentation or prolonged judgment of Suh's behavior.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement indeed carries a sarcastic undertone. The use of "not biased my ass" is a sarcastic way of emphasizing the perceived bias of the person they are addressing. This sarcastic element aims to mock the person for claiming objectivity while being biased. This aspect wasn't fully highlighted in the preliminary analysis, which mostly focused on the speaker's frustration. Ultimately, the statement is sarcastic.

The preliminary analysis focuses on the promotional nature of the tweet, "We are MAD Gamers," with the speaker implying enthusiasm and a desire to expand their presence within the gaming community through links and a call to follow the associated Twitter account. The hashtags suggest a geographical link, potentially reaching out to a local gaming audience in Wellington, New Zealand. The speaker's intent is clear—to promote and attract more followers.

The implicature here reveals that the speaker is part of a community called "MAD Gamers" and seeks to grow their audience.

The speaker's intent is to garner more followers and engagement, indicating they value the gaming group.

"Best Christmas Eve news: I have a half sister. 😂👍 #sarcasm #thanksdad"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is using sarcasm to imply that finding out about having a half-sister on Christmas Eve is not actually good news. The use of sarcasm and the "thanksdad" hashtag suggest that the speaker blames or resents their father for the situation.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely feels surprised, possibly frustrated or upset, and does not perceive the news of having a half-sister positively. The use of sarcasm often indicates that the speaker is not happy about the information.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they align in this case. The speaker implies negativity about the situation through sarcasm, and this matches their likely feelings of disapproval or dissatisfaction with the news.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude by using the phrase "Best Christmas Eve news" along with a laughing emoji and thumbs-up. However, the sarcasm and hashtags suggest the actual sentiment is negative regarding the unexpected family news.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker sarcastically refers to discovering the existence of a half-sister on Christmas Eve as "Best Christmas Eve news." The hashtag #sarcasm and #thanksdad, along with the laughing emoji and thumbs-up, convey that the speaker does not genuinely find the situation positive. Instead, the speaker aims to highlight their resentment or disapproval towards their father and the unexpected revelation. The literal phrasing contrasts sharply with the implied meaning, where the speaker feigns positivity.

The implicature denotes that the situation is undesirable. The presupposition taken for granted is that Christmas Eve should typically bring joyful news, not surprises of questionable nature. The statement's intent is to express dissatisfaction and irony, likely directed at the father, suggesting familial tension. The final tone has a negative polarity despite the surface-level positive words.

The statement is sarcastic, as it uses pretense to mask negative feelings about a newly discovered familial relationship on what is traditionally a joyful occasion. The preliminary analysis accurately identifies the sarcasm and correctly interprets the speaker's intent and underlying emotions.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies about the expense and what they think about the situation both align in portraying the price as excessive and likely unjustifiable.

Finally, the speaker does not seem to be pretending about their attitude toward the conversation. The comparison made between the fritter and the cost of a flat suggests genuine surprise or criticism regarding the price.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature**: The speaker implies that the Minky Wale tail fritter, an unusual or extravagant dish, is being sold at a ridiculously high price equivalent to a fashionable flat in Port Talbot, suggesting absurdity in the pricing.

**Presuppositions**: It is presupposed that the listener knows that both a "bijoux flat" and "Minky Wale tail fritter" are generally high-priced items, allowing the speaker to draw a parallel between them for comedic or critical effect.

**Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker, likely a critic or consumer, intends to mock or criticize the high pricing of the fritter by comparing it to real estate, pointing out the perceived absurdity or injustice of the cost.

**Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence is negative, as it highlights what the speaker perceives as an unreasonable pricing structure.

**Pretense**: There is no clear pretense in the speaker's attitude. Instead, they appear to genuinely express disbelief or disapproval over the pricing.

**Meaning**: The literal meaning discusses an unusual comparison, but the implied meaning emphasizes the absurd cost ratio between a food item and real estate, intended to criticize or amuse.

"New shirt #new #shirt #im #sorry #its #just #i #literally #do #not #care #at #all http://t.co/4L8inLJg9N"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies a sense of disinterest or nonchalance toward the new shirt or perhaps towards sharing this update on social media. The hashtags used suggest that they want to draw attention to their indifference.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to genuinely not care about the new shirt, hinting that they don't find it significant or worth much attention.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the implication of not caring and the explicit expression of indifference align well. Both suggest a lack of investment or interest in the topic.

The speaker appears to be sincere in their disinterest. There is no indication of sarcasm or pretense in their tone, despite the fact that sharing on social media might usually imply caring. The use of a very casual and dismissive expression suggests the speaker is genuinely indifferent.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Implicature: The speaker implies that they are not interested in the topic of the new shirt and perhaps suggests they feel obligated to share it on social media despite their indifference.

Presuppositions: It is taken for granted that sharing a new shirt on social media is expected or usual behavior, which typically implies some level of interest or excitement.

Intent of the speaker: The speaker aims to express disinterest or nonchalance. By emphasizing their indifference with hashtags, they might also be subtly criticizing or making fun of the social media habit of oversharing trivial updates.

Polarity: The tone is negative due to the phrase "I literally do not care at all."

Pretense: There appears to be no pretense; the speaker appears to honestly express their lack of concern or care.

Meaning: Literally, the statement is about introducing a new shirt, but implied is a critique or dismissal of the importance of this action.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it would seem the speaker is actually using sarcasm. By making the statement, they participate in the social media trend they claim to disdain, which introduces pretense. The phrase "I literally do not care" is often used sarcastically when people actually do care enough to make a statement. So, the speaker is likely sarcastic, downplaying their interest while drawing attention to it.

"Is there a 'like' tab on me? I'm not a Facebook status to be liked by people... #sarcasm #RudeButTrue"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they feel as though they are being treated superficially, similar to how people "like" a post on social media rather than genuinely engaging with them or valuing them as a person.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems frustrated with how people may be interacting with them in a shallow or superficial manner, likening it to the minimal interaction of simply liking a status update on Facebook.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts indicate dissatisfaction with superficial interactions, equating their treatment to the surface-level engagements typical of social media.

Finally, the speaker uses sarcasm and the hashtags "#RudeButTrue" and "#sarcasm," indicating that they are deliberately adopting a certain attitude or tone to emphasize their point. They are pretending to be humorous or lighthearted while expressing an underlying frustration with how they are being perceived or treated.

The statement "Is there a 'like' tab on me? I'm not a Facebook status to be liked by people... #sarcasm #RudeButTrue" is analyzed as follows:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that they are being treated in a shallow or superficial manner, akin to how people engage with Facebook posts by merely liking them instead of engaging deeper.

2. **Presuppositions**: The speaker assumes that the audience understands the context of social media interactions, specifically the notion of liking posts on Facebook, and infers that real-life interactions should be more meaningful.

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to highlight their frustration and dissatisfaction with how they are being treated by others. They express this through a sarcastic tone to emphasize their discontent and seek acknowledgment or reflection from their audience.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence is negative, reflecting the speaker's dissatisfaction with superficial interactions.

5. **Pretense**: Yes, the speaker uses sarcasm to disguise their frustration as humor, lightening the tone while still making a critical point about their social experience.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning is a question about having a 'like' tab, akin to Facebook, but the implied meaning is that the speaker resents being subject to impersonal, surface-level interactions.

Reflecting on this analysis, the statement is overwhelmingly sarcastic. The tags "#sarcasm" and "#RudeButTrue" further confirm the speaker's intent to use sarcasm as a tool to communicate their underlying frustration with superficial social dynamics. The sarcasm highlights a perceived devaluation of personal interaction compared to social media interactions.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that time and circumstances have changed since they initially moved to CR to escape the malls and materialism that they associated with the US.

**Meaning:** Literally, the speaker is recounting a move and a shopping experience. Implied, they are pointing out how their values or behaviors have come full circle in an ironic twist.

**Conclusion:** The statement is sarcastic. Although the preliminary analysis suggests a candid admission, the use of irony usually involves sarcasm, highlighting a point about the discrepancy between past intentions and current actions. The speaker uses irony to humorously critique their own situation, indicating sarcasm.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

The statement to analyze is: "Abnormal professor walks in with the finals in a Zoloft bag #irony #psychhumor"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is a sense of irony or humor in the situation of a psychology professor, who is associated with mental health education, carrying final exam papers in a Zoloft (an antidepressant medication) bag. This implies a connection between the stress of finals and the use of antidepressants, which is making the situation amusing to them.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker finds the situation humorous and ironic. They appear to be highlighting the contrast between the academic setting and the mental health-related imagery, finding it an amusing or fitting depiction for a psychology-related context.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think express the humor and irony in a psychology professor's seemingly casual or unintended nod to mental health issues through the Zoloft bag.

Finally, is the speaker pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation?
It does not appear that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude. Their use of "#irony" and "#psychhumor" suggests that they genuinely perceive the situation as humorous and are sharing their understanding of the situation's irony with the audience.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Abnormal professor walks in with the finals in a Zoloft bag #irony #psychhumor" is analyzed to determine its sarcastic nature. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies a humorous irony in the situation where a psychology professor, who deals with mental health topics, carries exam papers in a bag associated with an antidepressant. This juxtaposition highlights the stress of exams and the professor's field, enhancing the irony.

2. **Presuppositions**: It is presupposed that the audience is familiar with Zoloft as an antidepressant and understands the context of mental health within psychology education. It also assumes an understanding of the typical stress associated with finals.

3. **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker aims to share a lighthearted observation and amuse the audience by connecting the stress of finals to mental health discussions typical in psychology. The speakers, likely being students or colleagues, use humor to alleviate tension.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the final sentence is positive, conveyed through the hashtags "#irony" and "#psychhumor," which signal a humorous and playful tone.

5. **Pretense**: There is no indication of pretense in the speaker's attitude. The hashtags indicate a straightforward acknowledgment of the humor.

6. **Meaning**: Literally, the statement describes an unusual scene. Implied, it humorously connects the professor’s profession with the stress of exams through the visual of a Zoloft bag.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, there is no need for changes as the statement effectively examines humor and irony without hidden sarcasm. Thus, the statement is not sarcastic but rather an ironic observation conveyed with genuine amusement.

The speaker tweeted: "so if they undo the affordable care act, and I should expect my insurance to decline 33%? #Not #Gonna #Happen"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?  
The speaker implies skepticism or disbelief that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will lead to a decrease in insurance costs. The hashtags "#Not #Gonna #Happen" strongly suggest that they expect costs will not go down as a result of removing the law.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?  
The speaker appears to think that promises or suggestions that insurance premiums would decline substantially, specifically by 33%, after undoing the ACA are unrealistic or unfounded.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?  
Yes, both through implication and direct assertion, the speaker is conveying disbelief in the expected outcome of insurance costs dropping by the specified percentage if the ACA were to be undone.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.  
It does not seem that the speaker is pretending. Their skepticism and disbelief appear genuine, suggesting that they are critical of the narrative that dismantling the ACA would lead to such financial benefits.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement appears to be a sarcastic comment on the assumption that undoing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would lead to a considerable decline in insurance costs. By stating "I should expect" followed by the hashtags "#Not #Gonna #Happen," the speaker implies disbelief and mocks the idea that such a significant reduction in costs would occur. The tone is negative and skeptical towards the notion being critiqued.

The implicature implies skepticism, suggesting that the speaker does not believe insurance costs will decline by 33% if the ACA is undone. The presupposition is that such claims or promises have been made by others. The speaker's intent is to express doubt and criticism toward these promises, and they do so in a public forum (Twitter) with an audience likely including those who are familiar or sympathetic to their viewpoint.

The polarity of the statement's conclusion is negative, as it expresses doubt and disbelief. There is no pretense; the speaker's skepticism appears genuine. The literal meaning of expecting insurance costs to decline contrasts sharply with the implied meaning that such expectations are unrealistic.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker uses a sarcastic tone to emphasize disbelief in insurance costs decreasing by such a margin due to the repeal of the ACA. The statement uses irony to criticize the unrealistic expectations or promises regarding the financial impact of dismantling the ACA.

The tweet is: "I see the #irony of MY LAST 3 TWEETS COMBINED was lost entirely on a certain someone... Faith in humanity: -3% :("

- The speaker implies that their previous tweets were meant to be ironic, but the intended irony was misinterpreted or not understood by at least one person. This seems to be a source of frustration for the speaker.
- The speaker appears to be disappointed or disillusioned with whoever failed to grasp the irony in their tweets. Their comment about "Faith in humanity: -3%" suggests a somewhat humorous but still pointed exaggeration about their lowered expectations of people's ability to understand or appreciate irony.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned; both suggest a frustration or disappointment with people's ability to understand their irony.
- The tone of the tweet, including the reference to "Faith in humanity: -3%," suggests the speaker might be adopting a slightly exaggerated attitude for comedic effect. They seem to be expressing genuine frustration but are also making a playful, hyperbolic comment on the state of humanity.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement highlights the speaker's frustration over the failure of a certain individual to grasp the irony in their previous tweets. The implied message is that the speaker had attempted to convey subtle irony, which was unfortunately missed or misunderstood, leading them to make a humorous exaggeration about losing faith in people's ability to understand irony ("Faith in humanity: -3%"). The speaker employs hyperbole for comedic effect, suggesting a playfully negative sentiment.

Examining the tweet:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that their previous tweets contained a level of irony that was not understood by others, particularly by someone specific.

2. **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that the audience is or should be capable of recognizing and understanding irony.

3. **Intent of the speaker**: The speaker aims to express their displeasure and perhaps seeks validation or acknowledgment from an audience more attuned to irony. The speaker is possibly addressing a general audience or indirectly addressing the individual who missed the irony.

4. **Polarity**: The tone is negative, expressed through disappointment and a humorous quantification of lost faith in humanity.

5. **Pretense**: There is an exaggerated playfulness in the speaker’s attitude, indicating pretense in the negative sentiment.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning is about the speaker's loss of faith in humanity, while the implied meaning suggests commentary on people's comprehension skills, wrapped in humor.

Reflecting on this, the statement should be considered sarcastic. The exaggerated loss of faith in humanity when irony is missed implies that the speaker does not genuinely believe this, but is instead making a comedic jab at the situation.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their request for contact and expression of having not received a reply seem genuine based on the public message's urgency and directness.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement is directed at @IAOLLC, mentioning a previous attempt to reach out via Direct Message with address details, but with no reply yet. The speaker implies a need for follow-up communication, indicating they value a response or resolution. They seem frustrated by the lack of engagement from the recipient, feeling compelled to tweet publicly to elicit a reaction. The tone of the message shows urgency and dissatisfaction.

The intent of the speaker is clear: they want @IAOLLC to contact them either through email or direct message. This indicates a genuine need for communication, not sarcasm. There is no pretense in the speaker's tone or approach – the situation is straightforward. The polarity of the message could be interpreted as negative due to the frustration of no reply, but the message itself is a neutral call for action.

The literal meaning of the statement is a request for contact, while the implied meaning underscores the speaker's frustration due to the lack of response. Given the information provided, the statement does not exhibit sarcasm, as the speaker has a direct and literal intention with no underlying irony.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they have been reprimanded indirectly, possibly by someone who is passing on a message from another person. They suggest that this event is unpleasant and sets a negative tone for their day.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker implies they were indirectly reprimanded, which is unpleasant and sets a negative tone for their day. They express frustration or annoyance, indicated by the sarcasm that suggests they don't believe their day will truly be excellent. The speaker's implication and thoughts align, as both convey dissatisfaction and a negative impact on their mood. The use of sarcasm highlights a pretense of a positive attitude, masking their actual negative feelings. 

The polarity of the statement is negative, as the speaker sarcastically states it will be an "excellent" day, but clearly does not mean it. The pretense is evident as the speaker uses sarcasm to feign positivity, suggesting a stark difference between the literal and implied meanings. 

The preliminary analysis accurately identifies the sarcasm in the statement due to the mismatch between the expected reaction to being yelled at and the supposed "excellent" day. Thus, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"A Puppet at the #PTI rally wanting to make #NayaPakistan #irony http://t.co/3kAny6qhKr"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the situation at the PTI rally is ironic because a puppet is advocating for a 'new Pakistan' (Naya Pakistan), suggesting a contradiction or insincerity within the rally’s agenda or participants.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to think that there is a lack of authenticity or genuine motive at the rally. They likely see the puppet as a metaphor for someone being controlled or lacking agency while still championing significant change, hence the irony.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the speaker’s implication of irony and their thoughts on the authenticity of the situation align with each other. Both indicate a criticism of superficiality or control that seems counterproductive to genuine change.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending; they appear to express genuine criticism and skepticism regarding the sincerity and authenticity of the PTI rally's efforts towards Naya Pakistan.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker implies that there is irony in a puppet participating in a PTI rally advocating for "Naya Pakistan," suggesting that this reflects a contradiction or lack of sincerity within the rally's agenda or participants. The speaker believes there is a lack of authenticity or genuine motive, viewing the puppet as a metaphor for someone lacking autonomy or being manipulated, which contrasts with the intended message of significant change. The implication and the speaker's thought align, pointing to criticism of superficiality that undermines genuine transformation. The speaker does not pretend to adopt a different attitude, as they express authentic skepticism about the rally's sincerity.

Considering these aspects:
- Implicature: The puppet, a symbol of being controlled, is an ironic choice for a campaign championing new and independent change.
- Presuppositions: The participants in the rally believe in and advocate for a new and autonomous Pakistan.
- Intent: The speaker aims to highlight perceived hypocrisy or insincerity at the rally.
- Polarity: The tone is negative, as it critiques the credibility of the campaign.
- Pretense: There is no pretense; the criticism appears genuine.
- Meaning: The literal statement contrasts with the implied critique of the rally’s authenticity.

Based on the analysis, the statement is sarcastic. The use of the term "irony" points out the contradiction between the controlled nature of a puppet and the independent change being advocated, expressing skepticism towards the rally’s intentions..

Statement: "If you wanna look like a badass, have drama on social media #not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that having drama on social media is commonly associated with trying to appear tough or rebellious, but they actually believe it's not a genuine way to achieve that image.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that causing or participating in drama on social media is not a legitimate or respectable way to appear tough or appealing. They might view it as superficial or immature.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. They imply that having drama on social media isn't really a way to be a "badass" and they seem to think it's not a good way to achieve that appearance.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker doesn't seem to be pretending to have an attitude but rather is directly expressing their disdain or disapproval of using social media drama as a means to enhance one's image. Their use of "#not" at the end reinforces their sincerity in the statement.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies that creating drama on social media is often associated with trying to look tough or rebellious. However, they believe that this approach does not genuinely achieve that image.
  
- **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that people might think having drama on social media makes them look like a "badass."

- **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker aims to express their disapproval or ridicule of people who think social media drama makes them appear tough. The speaker is likely talking to those who engage in social media drama.

- **Polarity**: Negative, as the tone suggests disapproval or criticism.

- **Pretense**: There is no pretense. The speaker is directly expressing their viewpoint.

- **Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests that being involved in social media drama makes one appear like a badass. However, the implied meaning, reinforced by the hashtag "#not," suggests the opposite— that social media drama is not a legitimate way to look tough.

Reflecting on the analysis, the speaker's use of "#not" at the end signals sarcasm. The sarcasm is evident in how the statement is structured to initially seem like it supports the behavior, only to undercut it with the hashtag, indicating the speaker's true, negative opinion about social media drama. Therefore, the statement is sarcastic.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that despite the high number of casualties suffered by their people (reference to 26/11 and other terror attacks), they perceive that people from Pakistan have shown little to no sympathy towards the victims of these incidents.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to be frustrated and disappointed by what they see as a lack of empathy or sympathy from Pakistani people toward the victims of terror attacks that affected their populace.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both imply a sense of frustration and dissatisfaction with the perceived lack of empathy from Pakistan compared to the scale of loss experienced.

Summary of Preliminary Analysis:

Implicature: The speaker implies that despite significant casualties from terror attacks, particularly noting events on 26/11 and the cumulative deaths of over 10,000 people, they perceive a lack of sympathy from people in Pakistan.

Presuppositions: The speaker assumes that sympathy or acknowledgment from Pakistan should have been forthcoming in response to these attacks.

Intent: The speaker aims to express frustration and highlight what they perceive as an ironic situation, emphasizing a lack of expected empathy from Pakistan towards the victims of these attacks. The speaker seems to belong to a group affected by these terror attacks, likely referring to Indian citizens.

Polarity: The tone of the statement is negative, as indicated by the word "irony," which the speaker uses to criticize or express dissatisfaction.

Pretense: There appears to be no pretense; the speaker is genuinely conveying their feelings of frustration and disappointment.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Preliminary Analysis Summary:**

The statement implies dissatisfaction with the limited time allocated to spend with the speaker's son. The speaker feels the time from 3 pm to 8 pm is insufficient and unjust, as indicated by the sarcastic use of "fair huh?" followed by "#NOT." The presupposition is that the speaker expected or desired more time with their son, highlighting a likely dispute over custody or visitation rights. The intent of the speaker, likely a parent or guardian, is to express frustration and challenge the fairness of the situation, possibly seeking empathy or validation from others. The polarity of the statement is negative, characterized by frustration. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; their sarcasm clearly conveys their dissatisfaction.

**Reflection and Decision:**

The preliminary analysis accurately identifies the sarcasm in the statement. The literal meaning suggests a fair allocation of time, but the implied meaning reveals a sense of unfairness and frustration. The use of sarcasm, indicated by "that's fair huh? #NOT," confirms the speaker's dissatisfaction. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"Pretty excited about how you gave up on me. File Under: #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

The statement to analyze is: "you seem super smart MT "@GrannyMarried: @Docjp @JoAnnEileen ||#NO #BLEEDING happening in #WaterBoarding = it's #Not #Torture""

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker is sarcastically implying that the argument being made by @GrannyMarried is not intelligent. The original tweet argues that waterboarding is not torture because it doesn't cause physical bleeding. By prefacing the retweeted statement with "you seem super smart," the speaker implies that the reasoning is flawed or simplistic.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely disagrees with the assertion that waterboarding is not torture and finds the argument that it cannot be torture simply because there's no bleeding to be lacking or naive.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. The speaker uses sarcasm to indicate disbelief or disagreement with the reasoning presented in the original tweet.

Finally, I do not think the speaker is pretending to have a different attitude toward the conversation; rather, they are using sarcasm to express their true critical perspective on the argument that waterboarding is not torture.

The speaker says: "I actually just started crying while brushing my teeth due to lack of sleep, stress and test anxiety. Today's gonna be a good one... #not"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that their day is already off to a bad start, likely leading to a continuation of the stress and anxiety they are facing. The use of "#not" sarcastically suggests that they do not expect the day to improve.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely feels overwhelmed and negative about the day ahead, given their emotional reaction and the factors (lack of sleep, stress, and test anxiety) contributing to their distress.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's true feelings reflect a sense of skepticism and pessimism regarding how the day will unfold.

The speaker is not pretending to have a different attitude; their expression aligns with their genuine feelings of being overwhelmed and anticipates a challenging day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature**: The speaker is implying that despite saying "Today's gonna be a good one," they don't expect a good day. The hashtag "#not" is a clear negation of their own statement, highlighting the anticipated difficulties due to lack of sleep, stress, and anxiety.

**Presuppositions**: The speaker assumes that crying due to stress and lack of sleep is understood by the audience as a sign of distress. They seem to take for granted that such emotions are relatable and indicative of bad circumstances.

**Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker seems to be expressing their current emotional state and the struggles they're facing. They are likely sharing this to either seek sympathy or to connect with others who might relate to these feelings. The speaker likely expects the audience, who might be friends or followers, to understand their sarcasm and empathize with their situation.

**Polarity**: The last sentence has a negative tone, as it indicates the speaker's expectation that the day will not be good.

**Pretense**: There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are genuinely expressing their feelings of being overwhelmed and frustrated.

**Meaning**: The literal meaning of the statement suggests optimism ("Today's gonna be a good one"), but the implied meaning, emphasized by the hashtag "#not," is that the speaker actually expects the opposite—a difficult day.

Given this analysis, the original statement by the speaker is indeed sarcastic. The hashtag "#not" explicitly negates their earlier optimistic-sounding claim about having a good day, revealing their true expectation of ongoing stress and challenges. The preliminary analysis aligns well with this conclusion, recognizing the sarcastic tone in expressing skepticism about the day ahead. No changes are needed to the preliminary analysis.

"Loving how dominant the SEC is #Pause ..... #Not"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in sports, likely college football given the timing, is dominant, but they do not actually enjoy or appreciate this fact.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker is being sarcastic and actually dislikes or is mocking the dominance of the SEC, contrary to their initial statement.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  No, they are not. The initial statement appears to praise the SEC's dominance, but the hashtag "#Not" reveals sarcasm, indicating the opposite sentiment—that the speaker does not truly appreciate the SEC's dominance.

The speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude towards the SEC's dominance initially, but the use of sarcasm reveals their true, negative attitude toward the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Loving how dominant the SEC is #Pause ..... #Not" employs sarcasm. The speaker pretends to express admiration for the SEC's dominance, reflecting the conversational implicature that such dominance should be appreciated. However, the use of "#Not" indicates the opposite sentiment, that the speaker actually disapproves or mocks the SEC's dominance. The presupposition is that the audience understands the context of sports where the SEC is dominant and is aware of the typical admiration such dominance would entail. The speaker's intent is to convey disapproval or criticism, likely addressing fans or rivals of the SEC in a humorously negative tone. The polarity of the statement is negative, as indicated by the "#Not." The pretense lies in the speaker's initial expression of positivity which is undercut by sarcasm. The literal meaning of the statement suggests admiration, but the implied meaning conveys the speaker's actual lack of admiration. The preliminary analysis correctly identifies sarcasm, as the statement's literal and intended meanings differ significantly. Therefore, no changes are necessary, and the statement remains sarcastic.

**Decision on Sarcasm:**

The statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker uses sarcasm to mock the notion that a speaker would need help knowing when their talk is over. This is achieved through a tone of disbelief and ridicule, as indicated by both the shift in pretense and the literal versus implied meaning. There is no need for changes in the preliminary analysis as it accurately identifies the components of sarcasm in the statement.

The statement is: "It is good that very few businesses/govts in EM economies have borrowed much via dollar-denominated loans from international banks. #Sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a problem with businesses and governments in emerging market (EM) economies borrowing in dollar-denominated loans from international banks, and perhaps it would be better if they had engaged more in such borrowing.

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that there is an issue with the current low level of borrowing in dollar-denominated loans by businesses and governments in emerging market economies, suggesting that this situation might pose a risk or disadvantage.

2. **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that borrowing in dollar-denominated loans is a common practice and potentially beneficial for economic stability or growth in EM economies.

3. **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker, likely expressing a critical stance, aims to highlight a perceived problem or risk in the lack of such borrowing, potentially warning the audience of underlying vulnerabilities.

4. **Polarity**: The literal statement appears positive, but due to sarcasm, the actual tone is negative.

5. **Pretense**: There is a clear pretense in the speaker's attitude, pretending to view the situation positively while actually criticizing it.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests that the situation is good, while the sarcasm indicates that the speaker believes it to be the opposite, viewing the lack of borrowing negatively.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is clearly frustrated or upset about being lied to. They are using sarcasm to convey their displeasure with the situation.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks convey their dissatisfaction and annoyance with being lied to.

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; rather, they are using sarcasm as a rhetorical device to express their genuine frustration or annoyance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Gotta love being lied to.... #not" implies that the speaker does not actually love being lied to; in fact, they find it frustrating or upsetting. The use of the phrase "Gotta love" followed by the hashtag "#not" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. This sarcasm is used to express the speaker's true feelings, which are negative toward being lied to.

In the analysis:
- The implicature suggests the speaker is unhappy about being lied to, despite the sarcastic expression suggesting the opposite.
- The presupposition is that the speaker has experienced being lied to and expects the listener to understand this context.
- The intent of the speaker is to express dissatisfaction and annoyance through sarcasm, making it clear they do not appreciate being deceived. The speaker is the person who experienced the deceit.

The polarity of the message is negative, as the overall tone is one of displeasure or frustration. There is pretense in terms of using sarcasm to convey the opposite of the literal meaning. The literal meaning of enjoying being lied to is the opposite of the implied meaning, which communicates disdain.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it accurately captured the sarcastic nature of the statement. The speaker is indeed using sarcasm to highlight their real feelings toward being lied to, making the statement sarcastic.

"I reckon straight women fancy Victoria Secret models more than straight men do #victoriasecret #irony"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that straight women have a greater appreciation or admiration for Victoria Secret models than straight men do. The use of the word "fancy" suggests an interest or admiration that might traditionally be expected from heterosexual men towards models.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The statement suggests an ironic viewpoint where straight women are perceived to have more admiration for Victoria's Secret models than straight men, contradicting the societal expectation that men would naturally be more attracted to these models. The hashtag #irony indicates that the speaker recognizes this contradiction and finds it amusing or interesting. The implication is that societal assumptions do not necessarily reflect reality. The speaker does not seem to be pretending or displaying pretense; instead, they are open about their perspective.

**Analysis Determination:**

- **Implicature:** The statement implies that the assumption that men are more attracted to Victoria's Secret models than women is flawed.
- **Presuppositions:** It takes for granted that there is a stereotype or societal expectation associating straight men with a stronger attraction to these models.
- **Intent:** The speaker aims to highlight and humorize the contradiction between societal expectations and reality using irony.
- **Polarity:** The tone of the statement is light-hearted and not overtly negative despite the use of irony.
- **Pretense:** There is no pretense; the speaker's attitude appears genuine.
- **Meaning:** Literally, it might suggest a surprising admiration from women towards the models, while the implied meaning is to question and bring humor to stereotypical gender attractions.

After reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it remains consistent that the statement is sarcastic due to its use of irony and the play on societal expectations versus reality. The sarcastic nature is clear through the recognition of an ironic twist that viewers may not typically acknowledge openly.

The tweet implies that, despite the specific disappointments with the ending of the TLC match being "fubar" and a poor stairs match, the overall experience was enjoyable. The speaker's intent seems to be to give a balanced review, recognizing the flaws but still emphasizing the overall satisfaction with the live show. The tone is largely positive, focusing on the overall enjoyment, and there is no indication of pretense in their attitude. The literal and implied meanings align closely, as the speaker's criticism doesn't overpower the general positive sentiment. 

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, there's no need for changes as it aligns with the context and tone of the tweet. Hence, the statement is not sarcastic, as the overall message is a factual recount of a mixed but generally positive experience.

The statement is: "#not insured"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?  
The speaker implies that there is a situation or scenario in which they or something is not covered by insurance. This can hint at a potential risk or vulnerability due to the lack of insurance.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?  
While the tweet is extremely brief and lacks explicit context, by using the hashtag format, the speaker might be expressing a level of concern, resignation, or highlighting a notable issue regarding the lack of insurance. It could suggest dissatisfaction or simply an observation they want others to notice.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?  
Yes, both the implication and what the speaker might think are aligned in recognizing that something is uninsured. However, without further context, it's challenging to determine if the speaker is concerned or indifferent about this status.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.  
Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude. The brevity of the statement leaves much open to interpretation, though it comes off as a straightforward observation or concern.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "#not insured" implies that a situation or object lacks insurance coverage, introducing a potential risk or vulnerability. The speaker, using the hashtag, might want to spotlight this issue, indicating possible concern, resignation, or mere acknowledgment of the uninsured status. There's alignment between what is implied and what the speaker might think, as both recognize something is uninsured. Given the brief and vague nature of the statement, it's difficult to discern if the speaker is pretending or has a hidden attitude towards the situation— it appears as a straightforward comment or concern. The tone is rather neutral but could lean towards negative, given the common association of not being insured with potential issues.

Reflecting on this analysis, the statement appears non-sarcastic. There's no indication of irony or contradiction between the literal and implied meaning. It's a straightforward observation or remark about a lack of insurance coverage without pretense or sarcasm.

The statement made by @zainabimam is: "Malala is fake and planted by the US coz Pakistan is perfectly safe for kids going to school" #PeshawarAttack #Sarcasm

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is implying that the notion of Pakistan being "perfectly safe" for kids going to school is false. By using sarcasm, they suggest that the argument used by critics of Malala Yousafzai—that she was "fake" and "planted by the US"—is nonsense, given the existence of real dangers such as the Peshawar attack.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to believe that Pakistan is not entirely safe for children attending school, contrary to claims made by some people. The mention of the Peshawar attack highlights real threats to children's safety. They likely support Malala's cause and recognize the legitimacy of her concerns regarding education and safety in Pakistan.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the speaker's use of sarcasm aligns with their thoughts. The sarcasm ridicules the idea that Pakistan is absolutely safe for school children, which aligns with the speaker's belief in the dangers that exist, as highlighted by the Peshawar attack.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm as a rhetorical device, so they are not genuinely holding the attitude that Pakistan is perfectly safe or that Malala is a US plant. The sarcastic tone shows they are skeptical of those claims and appear critical of people who hold such views.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Malala is fake and planted by the US coz Pakistan is perfectly safe for kids going to school" is clearly sarcastic. The implication here is that the assertion of safety and the criticism of Malala are absurd, given the serious threats exemplified by the Peshawar attack. The speaker presupposes that the audience understands the context of the Peshawar attack and the safety issues in Pakistan. Their intent is likely to critique and dismiss the opinions of those who deny the dangers faced by children in Pakistan or undermine Malala's message and activism.

The polarity of the final sentence is negative; it presents a critical view of the situation. There is pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they pretend to agree with the unsound logic of Pakistan being completely safe to mock it. The literal statement claims safety and skepticism about Malala, while the implied meaning highlights the opposite: a recognition of real danger and support for Malala's cause.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it accurately identifies the sarcasm, critiques the misperceptions about safety, and supports the legitimacy of concerns over children's safety in Pakistan. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"I wonder what was the holiday rituals for true Africans"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies curiosity or perhaps a lack of knowledge regarding the holiday traditions or rituals specific to Africans who are considered "true," suggesting there may be misconceptions or stereotypes about African cultures and their practices.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to be questioning or seeking to understand more about authentic African cultural practices during holidays. There may be an underlying suggestion that they feel current knowledge or portrayals of African holiday rituals might not accurately reflect their true cultural significance.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the explicit curiosity suggest a desire for greater understanding and authenticity regarding African holiday rituals.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
There's no clear indication that the speaker is pretending. The statement seems to genuinely express curiosity and a lack of knowledge that they wish to address.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the speaker expresses genuine curiosity or a desire for understanding regarding authentic African holiday rituals. There is an implication of seeking knowledge and possibly questioning misconceptions or stereotypes about African cultures, which aligns with what the speaker explicitly states. 

In analyzing this statement for sarcasm:
- **Implicature:** The speaker asks a question, implying they do not have enough knowledge about "true" African holiday rituals, possibly hinting at underlying stereotypes or misconceptions.
- **Presuppositions:** It assumes that there exists a specific set of holiday rituals that are authentically "true" to Africans, which may not be commonly known or accurately portrayed.
- **Speaker's Intent:** The speaker appears to aim for a better understanding and possibly to challenge or clarify existing stereotypes or generalizations. 
- **Polarity:** The tone seems neutral, as it reflects curiosity and inquiry rather than negativity or criticism.
- **Pretense:** There's no evident pretense or ironic detachment; the statement appears straightforward.

**Meaning:** The literal meaning aligns with the implied message: expressing curiosity about authentic African holiday traditions.

Upon reflection, the statement does not demonstrate characteristics of sarcasm. The speaker seems to genuinely seek information or understanding without hidden motives or irony. Therefore, it is not sarcastic.

"When you're sick and you feel bad for your cells cause they're fighting hard for you. #blessed #appreciative #sarcasm #kinda"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that being sick triggers an awareness of the body's natural defense mechanisms, namely the cells working to fight the illness.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to have a somewhat humorous or sarcastic appreciation for their body’s efforts. Although they acknowledge the battle being fought by their cells, they might not genuinely feel "blessed" or "appreciative" in the traditional sense. There's an underlying tone of sarcasm, suggesting a mix of genuine and ironic sentiments.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Not entirely. While the implication is a positive acknowledgment of the body's defense mechanisms, the speaker's tone, which includes sarcasm, indicates that their appreciation might not be entirely genuine. They are likely expressing both gratitude and a bit of jest about the less-than-pleasant experience of being sick.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is likely pretending to some extent. The use of sarcasm (#sarcasm #kinda) indicates that while there might be a layer of genuine appreciation, the attitude is also meant to be humorous or ironic, at least partially downplaying the seriousness of the situation for comedic effect.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis provides insights into the tweet by considering the elements of implicature, presuppositions, intent, polarity, pretense, and meaning.

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies a humorous or sarcastic take on the body's efforts to fight illness, recognizing the cells' “hard fight” in an exaggerated manner.
- **Presuppositions**: There is an assumption that when one is sick, there's an internal effort by the body's cells to combat the illness.
- **Intent**: The speaker, likely someone experiencing illness, aims to convey a mix of genuine acknowledgment and humor. The use of hashtags like #sarcasm and #kinda suggests they are presenting their statement in a humorous or ironic light rather than a strictly serious one.
- **Polarity**: The inclusion of positive hashtags like #blessed and #appreciative juxtaposed with #sarcasm gives the statement a mix of positive acknowledgment with an underlying negative or ironic tone.
- **Pretense**: There is pretense in the attitude, as the speaker is not entirely serious about feeling "blessed" or "appreciative." It serves as an ironic commentary on being sick.
- **Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests genuine gratitude for the body’s health responses. However, the implied meaning, reinforced by sarcasm, portrays this gratitude in a humorous, less-than-serious manner, possibly as a way to cope with the discomfort of being sick.

Reflecting on these aspects, the statement qualifies as sarcastic. The analysis correctly identifies the nuances in tone, intent, and the speakers' use of pretense. The addition of humor and irony indicates the speaker's attitude is not literally sincere, acknowledging the cells’ efforts, but in a tongue-in-cheek manner.

The tweet says: "'Liberated' Iraq -- 2014 One of Bloodiest Years with More than 36,000 Victims: http://t.co/GCW05uriIT Thank you, Western liberators #sarcasm"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the situation in Iraq, even after its "liberation," is still very violent and chaotic, with 2014 being one of the bloodiest years. They suggest that the supposed liberation has not brought peace or stability to the country. 

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears to be critical of the Western forces, sarcastically thanking them for the "liberation" that resulted in a significant loss of lives. They likely believe that the intervention by Western countries has failed to bring about the promised positive outcomes and may have even exacerbated the violence.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the speaker's implication and thoughts align in criticizing the role of Western countries in Iraq's situation. Both indicate that the speaker thinks the intervention was unsuccessful and sarcastically labels it as "liberation."

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is using sarcasm to pretend to appreciate the efforts of the Western liberators. However, their true attitude, conveyed through the hashtag #sarcasm and the context, is one of criticism and disapproval.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis of the tweet indicates strong sarcasm directed at Western countries that have intervened in Iraq. The speaker implies that the so-called "liberation" did not result in improvement, revealing deep-seated criticism and disappointment. The use of the term "liberated" in quotes and the hashtag #sarcasm underscore this irony. They question the effectiveness of Western intervention by highlighting the violent outcome in 2014 and sarcastically thanking these forces, suggesting blame rather than gratitude.

Upon reviewing the analysis, the tweet is indeed sarcastic. The speaker's pretense of gratitude through sarcasm emphasizes their genuine disapproval and criticism of the current state, thus confirming the statement's sarcastic nature. The analysis aligns correctly with the elements needed to identify sarcasm, as the tweets' literal and implied meanings differ significantly.

"Can always count on you to speak to me on here then delete the messages so It looks like I'm talking to myself. 😒 @TristanReece_"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that Tristan Reece frequently deletes messages after sending them, leaving the speaker's replies visible without context, as if they are talking to themselves.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears to be frustrated or annoyed, as indicated by the emoji "😒". They likely feel displeased or embarrassed by being left in a conversation without the other party's messages visible.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the implication that Tristan frequently deletes messages aligns with the speaker's sentiment of frustration or annoyance. They believe this behavior is inconvenient or irritating.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
There is no indication that the speaker is pretending. The use of the emoji and choice of words suggest genuine annoyance or frustration with the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature:** The statement implies that Tristan Reece has a habit of deleting messages after sending them, which leaves the original speaker's responses looking out of context.

**Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that Tristan consistently deletes messages, and it is enough of a pattern that it prompts frustration from the speaker.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker hopes to express their annoyance and perhaps publicly call out Tristan's behavior on social media. The speaker seems to be someone who engages frequently with Tristan or has experienced this situation multiple times.

**Polarity:** The tone is negative, as indicated by the use of the annoyed emoji (😒) and the overall context of the statement.

**Pretense:** There is no pretense in the speaker's tone. They are overtly expressing frustration or annoyance without any undercurrent of humor or feigned politeness.

**Meaning:** The literal meaning of the statement suggests a level of dependability ("Can always count on you..."), but the implied meaning is sarcastic—it highlights an irritating behavior that the speaker finds frustrating or bothersome.

After analyzing the preliminary analysis, it's clear that the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker's phrase "Can always count on you" is typically used in a positive context, yet here, it is paired with an annoying habit, indicating sarcasm in highlighting Tristan's consistently inconvenient behavior. The emoji further underscores the speaker's genuine displeasure. The initial analysis accurately captures the frustration and sarcasm, and no changes are needed.

The speaker's statement is: "so glad I came to work at 7:30am for all the customers that are here!!!!!! #not #itsdead"

- The speaker implies sarcasm about the situation. By saying they're "so glad" and using the hashtag "#not," they imply that there is a lack of customers, and their early arrival to work feels unnecessary.
  
- The speaker likely feels frustrated or annoyed about having to come to work early when there are no customers, as implied by their use of sarcasm and the hashtag "#itsdead" to describe the lack of activity.

- What the speaker implies (their dissatisfaction with the situation) and what they think (the annoyance of being at work early with no customers) are essentially saying the same thing. Both reflect a negative sentiment toward the situation.

Finally, the speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; they're using sarcasm to express genuine annoyance about the lack of customers while implying that there was no need for them to start work so early.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "so glad I came to work at 7:30am for all the customers that are here!!!!!! #not #itsdead" heavily implies sarcasm. The speaker does not genuinely mean they are glad to be at work early; rather, they are expressing frustration and dissatisfaction with the lack of customers, using sarcasm to highlight the absurdity of their early start time given the emptiness of the workplace.

The implicature is that there are very few or no customers, hence their early arrival was unnecessary. The presupposition is that typically, arriving early is beneficial for serving many customers, but this expectation is not met here. The speaker aims to convey their frustration or annoyance about this wasted effort to their audience, who are likely familiar with similar situations.

The polarity of the statement is negative, showing that the speaker is not pleased with the current situation. There is no pretense in the attitude; the speaker is using sarcasm as a rhetorical tool to express genuine annoyance.

Thus, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic, as the literal meaning (being glad) and the implied meaning (being frustrated) are in direct opposition. The preliminary analysis accurately reflects the speaker's use of sarcasm to convey their true feelings. No major changes are needed in the assessment, as the statement is indeed sarcastic.

The speaker said: "Gotta love a Romanian playing an improvised version of jingle bells in a minor key. Really sets the festive mood. #not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the improvisation of 'Jingle Bells' in a minor key is not actually creating a festive mood, as one might typically expect from the song. The use of "Gotta love" followed by "Really sets the festive mood" in a sarcastic way, particularly with the hashtag #not, suggests the speaker finds the scenario to be the opposite of festive.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely finds the situation to be amusing or ironic, but ultimately not fitting for a festive occasion. They might appreciate the unusual twist on a traditional song, but clearly think it does not match the intended mood.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts suggest that the version of the song being played does not create a festive atmosphere and is instead seen as an ironic or humorous twist on the tradition.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is pretending to have an appreciative attitude toward the performance, but this is clearly sarcastic. The hashtag #not confirms that the speaker does not genuinely think the performance is festive or loving it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis of the statement suggests several aspects regarding sarcasm:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that the performance of "Jingle Bells" in a minor key does not evoke a festive mood, contrary to what one would expect from the song.

2. **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that "Jingle Bells" is traditionally associated with a cheerful and festive mood. The speaker assumes the audience understands this common association.

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker's intent is to convey amusement or irony. The speaker, likely a listener or observer of the performance, aims to humorously express that the musical rendition is unfitting for a festive occasion.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the statement, particularly emphasized with the hashtag #not, conveys a negative sentiment toward the performance from the perspective of traditional festive expectations.

5. **Pretense**: There is pretense in the speaker’s attitude; they feign appreciation for the performance, but their true sentiment is sarcastic, as highlighted by the use of #not.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests appreciation for the performance, while the implied meaning, bolstered by the hashtag #not, indicates a lack of genuine appreciation and suggests an ironic or humorous response.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it aligns well with the typical markers of sarcasm such as contradiction between literal and implied meanings, use of hashtags to convey irony, and an expectation that the audience will recognize the intended irony. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic. No significant changes are needed in the initial analysis.

"Testing water temperatures #excitingtimes #Not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that testing water temperatures is uninteresting or mundane. The use of the hashtag "#Not" suggests that they are being sarcastic about the activity being "exciting."

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that the task of testing water temperatures is dull or boring. They are likely undertaking this task out of necessity rather than interest.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and thinks are consistent. Both suggest that the task is not genuinely exciting.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is pretending to have an excited attitude through sarcasm, as indicated by the hashtag "#excitingtimes," followed by "#Not," which negates that excitement.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Summary of Preliminary Analysis:

The statement "Testing water temperatures #excitingtimes #Not" is analyzed for sarcasm. The implicature suggests the speaker is implying a lack of excitement for the task. The presupposition is that there is an expectation or a cultural tendency to find such mundane activities boring, and the intent is likely to express disdain for an uninteresting task. The overall polarity of the last part of the statement is negative, due to the negating hashtag "#Not". The use of "#excitingtimes" is meant to convey pretense, presenting a false sense of enthusiasm. The literal meaning suggests joy in the task, but the implied meaning contradicts this, highlighting boredom.

Reflection and Decision:

The preliminary analysis correctly identifies the sarcasm in the statement. The speaker is indeed using sarcasm to convey their boredom and lack of true excitement about testing water temperatures. Thus, the statement is sarcastic.

To summarize the analysis:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker's statement implies that the person being addressed is unusually or unexpectedly diligent with their responsibilities, suggesting a change from their normal behavior.
   
2. **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that the person is a Leo and that their behavior today is notably more serious than usual.

3. **Intent**: The speaker might intend to acknowledge or commend the person's intensified focus on responsibilities. The speaker appears to be someone familiar with the addressee's typical behavior, possibly reflecting on a change in that behavior.

5. **Pretense**: There does not seem to be any pretense; the speaker's attitude seems genuine.

Preliminary Analysis Summary:

The statement, "Some days are just better than others," suggests that the speaker is experiencing or acknowledging the variable nature of daily life. The implication is that not every day can be great, and the presupposition is that some days are naturally better than others without specifics. The speaker appears to have a resigned or accepting attitude, acknowledging the fluctuation in the quality of days.

1. Implicature: Implies that not every day is optimal and today's experience might reflect that.
2. Presuppositions: Assumes variability in daily experiences is typical and accepted.
3. Intent: To express a resigned or realistic perspective on daily life variability. The speaker seems to be an individual reflecting on their day.

4. Polarity: The tone is neutral or slightly negative as it hints at the current day not being one of the better ones.
5. Pretense: There is no indication of pretense; the attitude seems genuine and reflective.

6. Meaning: The literal meaning is that some days are simply better than others. The implied meaning suggests a personal experience of a less favorable day.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement does not include any markers of sarcasm. Sarcasm typically involves a discrepancy between a literal positive statement and a negative, critical or mocking implication. Here, the statement aligns in both its literal and implied meanings, lacking the duality often present in sarcasm.

Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

The statement "I love context and large ensemble Fridays!!!!! Der my most favourite #Sarcasm #GetTheFuckOut" carries an implied meaning that opposes its literal interpretation. The speaker implies they do not enjoy such Fridays, despite the literal claim of love for them. The hashtag #Sarcasm explicitly signals the ironic tone. The statement presupposes that the audience understands this sarcasm, and the negative tone is reinforced by the hashtag #GetTheFuckOut, indicating frustration or displeasure. The intent is likely to vent dissatisfaction to the audience. The polarity is negative, as indicated by the context and choice of words. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are clearly using sarcasm to convey a lack of favoritism.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, no changes are necessary—the statement is clearly sarcastic as identified. The speaker's use of hashtags and tone effectively communicates their true feelings without pretense. Thus, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

5. **Pretense**: There is no pretense; the speaker openly mocks the concept of trickle-down economics.

After analyzing the elements, it is clear the statement is sarcastic. The sarcastic tone is evident in the use of "trickle down fairy" and "#NOT" to mockingly reject the effectiveness of trickle-down economics. The preliminary analysis correctly identified the sarcasm, highlighting the speaker's genuine skepticism.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

"Woke up with my foot the size of a balloon, that's just what I needed.. #not #ouch"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that waking up to find their foot swollen is an unwelcome and inconvenient situation. The use of "that's just what I needed" followed by "#not" suggests sarcasm, indicating that this is the opposite of what they needed. 

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker clearly finds the situation to be negative and frustrating. The use of "#ouch" also indicates that there is pain associated with the swollen foot, adding to the overall sense of discomfort.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think appears to be the same. Both aspects highlight that the situation is undesirable and unwelcome.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
No, the speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude. The sarcasm used expresses genuine frustration and the hashtag "#ouch" indicates real discomfort. The statement seems to reflect the speaker's true feelings about their swollen foot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement by the speaker is clearly sarcastic. The speaker's intent is to express frustration over waking up with a swollen foot, which is inferred by the use of "that's just what I needed.." coupled with the sarcastic hashtag "#not." The implicature here is that this situation is precisely not what the speaker wanted, which is opposite to the literal phrasing. The presupposition is that waking up with a swollen foot is inconvenient and undesirable.

The literal meaning of the statement ("that's just what I needed") would imply a positive occurrence, but the use of "#not" negates this and reveals the sarcasm. The use of "#ouch" indicates genuine discomfort, reinforcing the negative tone of the situation.

In terms of polarity, the statement has a negative tone. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude as the sarcasm is used to genuinely express frustration and discomfort. The preliminary analysis correctly acknowledged the sarcasm, emotional tone, and intent of the speaker, thus no changes are necessary in understanding the statement as sarcastic.

The speaker seems to find the situation amusing enough to share, employing hashtags that suggest humor or innuendo about someone's attractiveness and an encounter at the picnic.

- The Presuppositions: It is assumed that the audience would understand the innuendo being referenced and find it amusing.

The speaker says, "lol the sucky thing about seeing beauty in everything? You see the beauty in a liar #BeautifulLiar #lovethwayyoulie #NOT"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that finding beauty in all things can be problematic because even dishonest individuals might appear beautiful or appealing despite their deceptive nature.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to recognize the downside of their optimistic perspective of seeing beauty everywhere, particularly in it leading to admiration or affection for someone unworthy of trust, like a liar.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the implication aligns with the speaker's thoughts in acknowledging the downside of their perspective, suggesting their understanding that seeing beauty in everything can sometimes have negative consequences, such as being misled by a deceitful person.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude; their tone conveys genuine acknowledgment of the irony and frustration in their situation. The use of "lol" indicates they might be lightly addressing their realization with a sense of humor, but they seem earnest in expressing their thoughts about seeing beauty in a deceptive person.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To determine if the statement is sarcastic:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that seeing beauty in everything is not always positive because it also means finding beauty in negative traits, like being a liar.

2. **Presuppositions**: The speaker takes for granted that people generally prefer not to see beauty in deceit or dishonesty and that identifying beauty in lies is undesirable.

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker seems to hope to highlight the irony and potential pitfalls of an overly optimistic worldview. They use humor to address a frustrating situation where someone deceitful appears beautiful to them. The speaker might be talking to themselves or addressing an audience that relates to this.

4. **Polarity**: The last sentence has a negative tone because it points out an undesirable outcome of seeing beauty in everything.

5. **Pretense**: There is some pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they use humor and the term "lol" to soften their criticism of an otherwise sincere observation.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning is that seeing beauty in a liar is unfortunate. The implied meaning is that an optimistic outlook can backfire by leading to admiration for undeserving individuals.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the speaker's tone is indeed sarcastic. The use of "lol" and hashtags like "#NOT" suggest they are not genuinely happy or accepting of the situation, rather they are frustrated and using sarcasm to express their realization and ironic situation.

The statement: "Yay I just love this time of the month...! #Sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker intends to convey displeasure or frustration despite their initial words suggesting excitement. The hashtag #Sarcasm explicitly clarifies their true sentiment.

**Polarity:** Negative tone, as indicated by the sentiments of frustration or dissatisfaction.

**Pretense:** Yes, the speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude, as they are using sarcasm to express the opposite of what is literally stated.

**Meaning:** The literal meaning of the statement suggests enthusiasm and love for this time of the month, but the implied meaning, underscored by the hashtag, is that the speaker finds this period unpleasant.

The statement is: "Kid who tried stealing tools from me is now mad cuz someone took his hot sauce out of the fridge at work #Irony"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is a sense of irony or humor in the situation where someone who has attempted theft (stealing tools) is now upset about someone taking their belonging (hot sauce). The speaker sees a contradiction in the thief being upset about being a victim of a minor theft.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely finds the situation amusing or ironic, thinking it's hypocritical for the person who stole from them to be upset about someone else stealing from them. The use of the hashtag "#Irony" suggests they are highlighting this contradiction with a tone of sarcasm or jest.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, what the speaker implies and thinks are aligned. Both suggest that the speaker finds humor or irony in the fact that the person is experiencing a consequence similar to what they tried to inflict on the speaker.

Finally, is the speaker pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation?
No, the speaker is not pretending; their statement genuinely reflects their amusement and perception of irony in the situation. They seem to be expressing their true reaction to the irony they observe.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To summarize the preliminary analysis:

1. **Implicature:** The speaker implies the hypocrisy and humor in the situation where someone who attempted theft is upset about a minor theft against themselves.
2. **Presuppositions:** The speaker assumes that both their audience and the subject of the tweet understand the irony in the thief's situation.
3. **Intent:** The speaker, in this case presumably the victim of the original theft attempt, wants to highlight the funny hypocrisy in the thief's behavior, drawing attention to the irony they perceive.
4. **Polarity:** The tone of the statement is negative towards the "kid" trying to steal but amused or positive in a sense of irony regarding the situation.
5. **Pretense:** There doesn't appear to be pretense; the speaker is genuinely amused by the irony without having to mask their true sentiment.
6. **Meaning:** Literally, the statement is about a person being upset that their hot sauce was taken. Implied, it comments on the irony and hypocrisy of a thief being upset about theft.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, nothing substantial should be changed. The statement indeed seems sarcastic. The use of irony and the hashtag "#Irony" point towards a sarcastic observation of the situation where the speaker is pointing out the hypocrisy of the kid's anger. The statement is clearly sarcastic as it mocks the hypocrisy of the "kid" and is intended to highlight how they are getting a taste of their own medicine.

"Rest in peace riff God! #Dimebag #Darrell #is #not #dead #pantera"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies a sense of loss or mourning by saying "Rest in peace," commonly used to honor someone who has passed away. At the same time, the hashtags, especially "#is #not #dead," suggest a contradiction or protest against the idea that Dimebag Darrell is dead, perhaps indicating that while he may have physically passed away, his music and influence are very much alive.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that although Dimebag Darrell has passed away, his legacy lives on through his music and influence in the heavy metal community. They may also be expressing a personal sentiment that Darrell's impact is too significant to be overshadowed by his death.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts converge on the idea that while acknowledging Dimebag Darrell's death, his legacy and influence remain a strong and living presence within the music world and among his fans.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.

**Implicature**: The speaker is implying that while Dimebag Darrell may have passed away, his music and impact remain influential, challenging the notion that he is truly "dead" in a legacy sense.

**Presuppositions**: It is presupposed that Dimebag Darrell is a significant figure in music, specifically within the heavy metal genre, and that he has passed away.

**Intent of the Speaker**: The intent is to honor Dimebag Darrell and emphasize that his influence persists despite his physical absence. The speaker likely hopes to connect with others who share admiration for Darrell's contributions to music. 

**Polarity**: The tone is generally positive, focusing on the ongoing influence rather than the loss.

**Pretense**: There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; the speaker is genuinely expressing respect and admiration.

**Meaning**: The literal meaning is a call for rest in peace for Dimebag, but the implied meaning is a testament to his continued legacy and presence within the music community, contrasting the notion of being "dead."

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it is clear that the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker's message is sincere, highlighting admiration and enduring influence rather than any contradictory or mocking tone typically found in sarcasm. The hashtags, particularly "#is #not #dead," serve to emphasize the lasting imprint of Dimebag Darrell's work, aligning with the speaker's genuine sentiment rather than a sarcastic contradiction.

The speaker provides a link to a video that claims a smartphone can pay you to post and attaches multiple hashtags related to popular smartphone brands and models, as well as multi-level marketing (MLM).

- The speaker implies that there is an opportunity or a system in place that allows individuals to make money through their smartphones by posting content.
- The speaker seems to have a positive and promotional outlook on the situation, suggesting enthusiasm for the opportunity to earn money with smartphones.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and thinks seems to be the same. They believe in the legitimacy and potential of earning through posting with a smartphone, as suggested by the enthusiasm in their message and use of encouraging hashtags.

The speaker might be pretending to have a neutral or positive attitude, but it's also possible they are genuinely excited or involved in promoting this concept, potentially as part of a multi-level marketing strategy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis identifies that the speaker uses a promotional tone to share the idea that a smartphone can compensate users for posting content, with specific references to well-known smartphone brands and terms associated with multi-level marketing (MLM). The shared link and enthusiastic hashtags suggest an investment in either promoting or believing in this potential income stream.

To decide if the statement is sarcastic, let's break down the elements:

**Implicature**: The speaker implies there is a genuine opportunity to earn money by using a smartphone to post content, suggesting a financial benefit.

**Presuppositions**: The statement assumes that the audience is familiar with the power of smartphones and interested in financial opportunities through them, particularly in the context of MLM.

**Intent**: The speaker likely aims to attract viewers to the video link by emphasizing a potentially lucrative opportunity, possibly recruiting them into a MLM scheme.

**Polarity**: The overall tone is positive, focusing on a promising earning opportunity.

**Pretense**: There's a possibility of pretense if the speaker is trying to mask skepticism about the opportunity's authenticity; however, the use of enthusiastic hashtags points more towards genuine excitement.

**Meaning**: The literal message is that a smartphone can pay users to post, while the implied message leans towards promoting this concept, possibly as part of an MLM effort.

Considering these points, the statement does not exhibit sarcasm. Instead, it demonstrates a promotional message aimed at generating interest or engagement with the attached video. The enthusiasm and lack of evident contradiction between the literal and implied meanings suggest sincerity more than sarcasm.

The statement is: "This nigga knocced back 6 shots of Henny lastnight ! @king_macjay http://t.co/oPMLzS4OuY"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that @king_macjay consumed a significant amount of Hennessy (6 shots) the previous night. The use of exclamation marks suggests that the speaker finds this event noteworthy, possibly due to the high quantity of alcohol consumed.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to be highlighting the amount of alcohol consumption as something impressive or surprising. The tone could be seen as one of amazement or disbelief at the ability to consume a large quantity of alcohol.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both what the speaker implies and thinks are aligned in suggesting that the consumption of 6 shots of Hennessy by @king_macjay is remarkable and significant.

Finally, it does not seem that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. The choice of language and tone appears genuine, expressing a mix of surprise and astonishment at the event.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the speaker is genuinely surprised and finds it noteworthy that @king_macjay consumed 6 shots of Hennessy, as indicated by the exclamation mark. The statement lacks pretense, given that the speaker's language conveys authenticity in expressing amazement or disbelief. The literal and implied meanings align, reinforcing the sense that this level of alcohol consumption is considered remarkable by the speaker.

Reflecting on the analysis, the emphasis on the notable consumption may contain an implicit tone of admiration or incredulity, given cultural contexts where such consumption could be brag-worthy or impressive. However, without further context or a negative tone, sarcasm isn't evident.

Therefore, the statement does not appear sarcastic; rather, it comes across as an enthusiastic or surprised remark about the event that occurred.

The statement is: "The Bay Area storm is so big that tons of people's work was canceled today, causing me to be early to mine. #irony #stormageddon"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that despite the storm being severe enough to cancel many people's work, they still had to go to their job and ended up arriving early.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to find the situation amusing or unexpected, as indicated by the use of the hashtag #irony. They seem to find it ironic that while others are getting the day off or are affected by the storm, they are still going to work and even arriving early.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both imply and think that the situation is ironic and somewhat amusing, given the context that a major storm is causing widespread disruptions while the speaker's personal outcome is the opposite.

Finally, the speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation; they genuinely seem to find the irony in their situation humorous and are sharing it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the speaker is highlighting the irony of the situation: while a major storm has led to the cancellation of work for many people in the Bay Area, the speaker's own situation is the opposite, as they end up going to work early. The implied humor and irony are underscored by the use of hashtags like #irony and #stormageddon. The speaker seems genuinely amused by the contrast between the storm's impact on others versus its impact on them.

In terms of sarcasm analysis:

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies that the day's events unfolded unexpectedly, with the severe storm allowing them to be early for work, which is ironic given the context.
- **Presuppositions**: It is assumed that the storm is serious enough to disrupt normal daily activities like work.
- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to convey both their amusement and the unexpected twist of events by sharing this irony with an online audience.
- **Polarity**: The tone overall has a humorous and slightly positive tilt due to the speaker's amusement at the situation.
- **Pretense**: There is no pretense; the speaker appears genuinely amused.
- **Meaning**: Literally, it's a statement about going to work early due to a storm. Implied, it's showcasing the unexpected and ironic nature of events.

Based on these analyses, the statement appears to be ironic rather than sarcastic. The use of the hashtag #irony reinforces this interpretation, focusing more on the unexpected outcome rather than the criticism or mockery typically associated with sarcasm. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

Statement: "08:01am on the dot and the buzzer rings #helloworld #not #sleepy #tired #nothanks"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they were awoken or interrupted at exactly 8:01 am by the buzzer, possibly an alarm or notification. The use of hashtags suggests they are not in the mood to enthusiastically face the day and they are already feeling tired.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely feels annoyed or exasperated by having to wake up or begin their day at this specific time. The speaker is communicating a sense of reluctance or tiredness.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think center around the sentiment of displeasure or reluctance about being awake or having to start their day at that moment.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
It does not appear that the speaker is pretending to have a particular attitude; their hashtags and straightforward expression of tiredness seem to genuinely reflect how they feel about the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "08:01am on the dot and the buzzer rings #helloworld #not #sleepy #tired #nothanks" conveys the speaker's displeasure at being awoken by a buzzer at exactly 8:01 am. The speaker implies a lack of enthusiasm for facing the day, suggesting annoyance or reluctance due to feeling tired. There is no indication of pretense in the attitude expressed; the use of hashtags like #tired and #nothanks underscore genuine fatigue and disinterest.

Analyzing the components of the statement:
- **Implicature**: The speaker is awakened or interrupted, hinting at inconvenience or annoyance.
- **Presuppositions**: The buzzer is an unwelcome start to their day.
- **Intent**: To communicate tiredness and lack of enthusiasm for the day, possibly to connect with others feeling similarly.
- **Polarity**: Negative, due to the use of words like "not," "tired," and "nothanks."
- **Pretense**: Absent; the speaker's tiredness appears genuine.
- **Meaning**: While the literal meaning focuses on the time and buzzer, the implied meaning is about the speaker's reluctance and fatigue.

Considering these elements, though the speaker clearly expresses dissatisfaction, there is no exaggeration or pretense that signals sarcasm. The statement does not appear sarcastic; it reads as a genuine expression of tiredness. The preliminary analysis is accurate in identifying this genuineness.

The tweet reads: "No one up? Okay cool #not"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they are possibly trying to reach out or engage with others but find no one available or awake to respond or interact with them. The hashtag "#not" suggests sarcasm, indicating they are not actually fine with the situation.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to be frustrated or disappointed about not having anyone to interact with. The use of sarcasm through "#not" implies they are unhappy about the lack of responsiveness or company.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  No, they are not saying the same thing. The straightforward statement "Okay cool" would typically imply they are fine with no one being up, but the hashtag "#not" contradicts that, showing their true feelings of dissatisfaction.

Finally, the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. They initially present a nonchalant attitude with "Okay cool," but reveal their true, more frustrated feelings with the sarcastic "#not."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker implies dissatisfaction with the situation, subtly hinting that they expected interaction or company but found none. Their statement initially seems calm with "Okay cool," but the hashtag "#not" immediately suggests sarcasm. The speaker hopes to express their frustration and disappointment about others not being available. The polarity of the statement is negative, reflecting the speaker's true, unfavorable feelings. The sarcasm is clear as the speaker pretends to be nonchalant, but the hashtag reveals their real frustration. The literal statement contrasts with the implied one, as the speaker doesn't mean the "Okay cool" genuinely. The preliminary analysis is accurate, confirming the statement is sarcastic.

"5 dollar OBX 1 dollar Gboro gone #lockitin #lottoclub #bankopen #doumenturdeposit#not criminal http://t.co/nYsbehzJqS"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker seems to be referring to a specific financial transaction or investment, potentially lottery-related, where amounts like "$5 OBX" and "$1 Gboro" are involved and now are "gone." They might be implying that these values have been secured or used, as indicated by the hashtags like "#lockitin" and "#bankopen."

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker might believe that this transaction or series of actions is legitimate and possibly something to assure others that it is not a criminal activity, considering the use of the hashtag "#not criminal." They might feel confident or relieved about the handling or outcome of this situation.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's indicated thoughts suggest that a financial action has been executed and that there is a concern to emphasize its legitimacy, as reflected in the defensive use of "#not criminal."

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending; rather, they seem defensive about the legitimacy of the situation. They emphasize not being associated with criminal activity, suggesting they are genuine in explaining or announcing the nature of the transaction.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies they've engaged in a financial transaction, possibly connected to a lottery or investment.

- **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that the financial action involves some risk or suspicion of illegitimacy, necessitating the reassurance tag "#not criminal."

- **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker seems to aim to inform or assure others about the legitimacy and security of their transaction, as well as distance themselves from any criminal connotation.

- **Polarity**: The use of hashtags like "#not criminal" indicates a cautious or defensive tone, not overtly negative, but addressing potential skepticism.

- **Pretense**: There is a lack of pretense; the speaker genuinely appears to want to clarify the authenticity of the situation.

- **Meaning**: The literal meaning discusses specific amounts and locations (OBX, Gboro) involved in a transaction. The implied meaning is focused more on assuring legitimacy and dismissing any interpretation of wrongdoing.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement does not seem sarcastic. The speaker seems earnest in emphasizing that their activity is lawful, as the use of "#not criminal" directly addresses concerns without irony. The speaker's tone is defensive rather than mocking or satirical. Changes to the analysis could include a deeper look into the context of financial jargon or local references (OBX, Gboro) for accurate comprehension if needed. Ultimately, the firm and serious tone suggests sincerity rather than sarcasm.

The speaker implies that being in England would currently have a noticeable impact or relevance to the conversation. By using the winking emoji ";)", it suggests there's a humorous or ironic element to their statement, possibly implying something about the weather, political situation, or a cultural event that someone in England would understand or be affected by. 

The speaker seems to think that the situation is relatable or significant for those in England and is hinting that the other person might not be experiencing it, hence they're perhaps fortunate or missing out, depending on the context.

What the speaker implies (that there's something noteworthy about being in England right now) and what they think (that it's humorous or ironic that the other person is not there to experience it) are saying essentially the same thing.

It does not seem like the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude; rather, they are more likely engaging in playful banter and highlighting a situational observation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement implies that there is something notable or distinctive about being in England at the moment, which is not immediately obvious from the literal text. The use of the winking emoji ";)" suggests a humorous or ironic undertone, indicating an informal and lighthearted interaction. The speaker presupposes that if the other person were in England, there would be a noticeable difference in their experience or understanding of a current event. The intent is likely to jest or engage in friendly banter with @TheLuluLife to point out the contrast between their respective situations.

The polarity of the statement leans towards a positive tone as it conveys a sense of humor or irony rather than criticizing or lamenting. There is no strong indication of pretense in the speaker’s attitude; instead, it seems that they are genuinely engaging in lighthearted banter.

The difference between the literal and implied meaning lies in the specifics of the English situation that cannot be inferred directly from the statement—the speaker assumes shared context or knowledge that someone in England would naturally recognize. 

In reflection, the preliminary analysis accurately captures the tone and intent, and traces the context effectively. The statement carries a subtle sarcastic undercurrent, as it seems to ironically suggest that the other person is "missing out" or "fortunate" not to be in England, thus confirming it as sarcastic.

The tweet states: "Ahem... yeah.. something like that ;)#irony is one of the few things keeping sanity when facing RU propaganda. #CrazyIvan"

- The speaker implies that irony is a coping mechanism for dealing with the absurdity or frustration of Russian propaganda. By using irony, they suggest that they need to maintain their sanity in the face of something they perceive as "crazy" or irrational, as indicated by the phrase "CrazyIvan."
- The speaker seems to view the situation with Russian propaganda as something deeply frustrating or absurd. They suggest that it is challenging to face it seriously without some form of mental relief—irony, in this case.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are aligned. They imply that irony helps to deal with the “craziness” of propaganda, and they think irony is necessary to maintain sanity in such situations.
- The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude. The use of irony and the hashtag suggest a genuine sentiment of finding a humorous or ironic perspective as a legitimate way to cope with what they see as disinformation or propaganda.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis of the tweet suggests several points:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that irony is a vital tool for maintaining sanity when confronted with Russian propaganda, highlighting it as a strategy to deal with absurdity or frustration.

2. **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that Russian propaganda is viewed as irrational and challenging, requiring mental relief through irony.

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker, likely someone frustrated with Russian propaganda, aims to express their reliance on irony to cope with perceived absurdities.

4. **Polarity**: The overall tone is negative, focusing on the need for sanity amidst frustration.

5. **Pretense**: There is no apparent pretense in the speaker's attitude; the irony is genuinely presented as a coping mechanism.

6. **Meaning**: Literally, the statement acknowledges irony as helpful; implied is a commentary on the irrationality of propaganda.

Reflecting on this analysis, the tweet is indeed sarcastic. The use of the phrases "Ahem... yeah.. something like that ;)" and "#CrazyIvan" suggests irony by indicating an understanding between the speaker and the audience about the absurdity and frustration of the situation, thus not taking it at face value. The recognition of irony as a coping method further underscores the sarcasm in addressing the serious matter of propaganda with humor.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of the Preliminary Analysis:**

The speaker's tweet indicates an intention to go to bed earlier than usual in hopes of getting more sleep. However, they find themselves unable to sleep, lying awake since 2 am, and acknowledging ironically that despite their efforts, their total sleep for the week is only 10 hours. The use of "early" in quotes and the hashtag "#irony" suggests that while the speaker planned for more rest, it existing reality diverges from their expectation, leading to a sense of irony and frustration.

- **Implicature:** The speaker implies that their intention to improve their sleep schedule has failed, and they are frustrated by their inability to achieve more sleep despite trying. 
- **Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that going to bed early should result in more sleep, and that the speaker values sleep but is having trouble securing it.
- **Intent:** The speaker, likely addressing a general audience or their social media followers, intends to express frustration and acknowledge the irony of their situation, possibly seeking sympathy or camaraderie from others who might experience similar issues.
- **Polarity:** The last sentence conveys a negative tone, highlighting disappointment and irony.
- **Pretense:** There doesn't appear to be pretense in the speaker's attitude; they genuinely express their frustration and view of the situation as ironic.
- **Meaning:** The literal meaning is the speaker attempted to sleep early but couldn't; the implied meaning is the situation is ironic and frustrating as it defies their expectations of getting restorative rest.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement’s use of irony in the hashtag and quotations around “early” suggests sarcasm, as the speaker attempts to find humor or irony in their misfortune. Therefore, the statement is sarcastic.

The statement presents an ironic situation where the American Red Cross van, associated with saving lives, has a driver who is smoking—a habit linked to health risks. The speaker implies there's a contradiction in this scenario. The speaker likely finds the situation amusing or absurd because the driver's behavior contrasts sharply with the message on the van.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker uses irony to implicitly criticize the inconsistency without explicitly stating it, and there's a comedic undertone in the contrast they draw.

"Don't know if I can handle this crazy 11-2 shift. It's so long I might pass out on the job! #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the 11-2 shift is not demanding or long at all. The use of sarcasm suggests that they believe it is, in fact, a short and manageable work shift.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?

The preliminary analysis suggests that the statement is sarcastic. Here's a breakdown of the elements involved:

Implicature: The speaker implies that the 11-2 work shift is not challenging or lengthy, contrary to their exaggerated complaint.

Presuppositions: There is a presupposition that a work shift between 11-2 is typically considered short and manageable. The speaker assumes the audience shares this understanding to appreciate the sarcasm.

Intent of the speaker: The speaker intends to humorously express that the shift is not difficult, aiming to entertain or connect with others who understand the joke.

Polarity: The tone of the statement is negative, as it sarcastically exaggerates the difficulty of the shift.

Pretense: There is pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they exaggeratedly present the shift as tiring, when they likely find it easy.

Meaning: The literal meaning is a complaint about the shift being long and challenging, while the implied meaning is that it isn't long or difficult at all, thereby highlighting the sarcasm.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic as the speaker's literal words are in direct contrast to the intended implication. There is no change needed in the preliminary analysis.

"My son gave me a cold......again!!! Yay! #sarcasm #NotExcitedAboutThisShitAtAll"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that their son frequently gives them colds, as indicated by the word "again." By adding "Yay!" followed by the hashtag "#sarcasm," the speaker implies that they are actually not pleased about receiving the cold, contrary to what the exclamation suggests.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks negatively about the situation. They are frustrated or annoyed that they have caught a cold from their son and clearly aren’t happy about it. Their use of sarcasm and the hashtag "#NotExcitedAboutThisShitAtAll" indicates that they are expressing displeasure.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
No, they are not saying the same thing. The implication through sarcasm ("Yay!") contrasts with their actual feeling about the situation, which is unhappiness or irritation, not excitement.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude toward the situation by using the word "Yay!", but their true attitude is conveyed through sarcasm and the hashtags indicating they are not at all excited or pleased.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "My son gave me a cold......again!!! Yay! #sarcasm #NotExcitedAboutThisShitAtAll" is clearly sarcastic. The analysis highlights several key points:

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that receiving a cold from their son is an unwanted recurring event, as seen with the word "again."

2. **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that the speaker's son is a frequent source of illness for them.

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker uses sarcasm to express their annoyance and frustration over being sick again due to their son. The primary intent is to vent and perhaps seek empathy from others, indicating the speaker is likely a parent sharing a common parenting mishap.

4. **Polarity**: The tone is negative. Although "Yay!" suggests excitement, the overall sentiment is dissatisfaction, emphasized by the negative hashtag "#NotExcitedAboutThisShitAtAll."

5. **Pretense**: There's a pretense of enthusiasm ("Yay!") which is undercut by the sarcastic hashtag, revealing the true negative sentiment.

6. **Meaning**: The literal statement seems positive, but the implied meaning through sarcasm is negative, indicating displeasure and irritation over the situation.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the evaluation is consistent with all aspects pointing to sarcasm; there is nothing that needs changing in the assessment. The speaker uses sarcasm to underscore their annoyance with the recurring situation of catching a cold from their son. Thus, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

The statement is "@TheStarPhoenix #spnews #yxe I hope you weren't driving when you took that picture. #irony"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a photo that looks like it was taken while someone was driving, which may not be safe or responsible behavior. By using the hashtag #irony, they are suggesting that this situation is contradictory or hypocritical, perhaps because the person they are addressing is expected to adhere to or promote safe driving practices.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to be critical or disapproving of the action implied (taking a picture while driving), considering it irresponsible behavior. They might feel that it's ironic because a media outlet like The StarPhoenix might be expected to model or report on safe behaviors, not exhibit the opposite.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they both align. The speaker implies that the practice of taking pictures while driving is unsafe and irresponsible, and they think that adhering to safe practices is important, especially by those who might influence public behavior or opinions.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker doesn't seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; their use of irony indicates genuine criticism of the potential behavior, pointing out the contradiction in the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Based on the preliminary analysis:

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies that the entity being addressed, The StarPhoenix, might have compromised safety by taking a photo while driving, which contradicts the expectations of safety and responsibility typically associated with news organizations.

- **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that a photo was indeed taken and potentially while someone was driving. There’s also an assumption that driving while taking pictures is generally considered irresponsible.

- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker, likely a concerned citizen or reader, aims to highlight the irony and potential irresponsibility of the action, possibly to prompt a reconsideration of such actions by The StarPhoenix.

- **Polarity**: The tone is negative as it points out perceived hypocrisy and irresponsibility.

- **Pretense**: There doesn’t appear to be pretense; the criticism seems genuine. The phrase "I hope" indicates a sarcastic pretense of a courteous wish, given the existing criticism.

- **Meaning**: Literally, the phrase expresses a hope that the picture wasn't taken while driving. Implied, it criticizes the irresponsible action and highlights irony given the assumed role of a news organization.

Reflecting on this analysis, the tone, use of #irony, and context suggest that the statement is indeed sarcastic. While the literal meaning expresses hope for responsible behavior, the implied meaning points out the contradiction and criticizes the entity for not adhering to safety standards they might typically endorse. The analysis should have explicitly stated the sarcasm more clearly in the context of pointing out hypocrisy. Thus, yes, the statement is sarcastic.

The speaker's tweet is: "I like to think of myself as a broken down Justin Bieber - my philosophy professor, everyone. #sarcasm"

- The speaker implies that their philosophy professor made a self-deprecating or facetious statement comparing themselves to a less successful or troubled version of Justin Bieber. By adding the hashtag #sarcasm, the speaker suggests that the comparison was made humorously and not to be taken at face value.
  
- The speaker seems to find the comment made by their professor amusing or ridiculous, likely viewing it as an exaggerated and humorous expression rather than a literal self-assessment.
  
- Yes, what the speaker implies (that the professor made a sarcastic or humorous statement) and what the speaker thinks (that the statement is amusing or self-deprecating) align in this case. The speaker is sharing this moment because they find it funny or noteworthy due to its sarcastic tone.

The speaker is not pretending to have a different attitude; they genuinely seem amused by the sarcastic comment made by their professor, as indicated by their use of the hashtag #sarcasm.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement suggests that the speaker's philosophy professor humorously likened themselves to a 'broken down Justin Bieber,' implying both self-awareness and self-deprecation. The hashtag #sarcasm indicates that the statement shouldn't be interpreted literally. The speaker likely shared the comment because they found the professor's self-comparison amusing and intentionally exaggerated.

In examining the implicature, it is clear that the comparison to Justin Bieber is meant to be humorous rather than sincere. The presupposition is that the audience understands both who Justin Bieber is and why being compared to a 'broken down' version of him would be humorous.

The speaker's intent is probably to share a moment of humor or irony exhibited by the professor. The polarity of the overall tweet is positive, as it is shared in good humor without any malice.

There is no pretext in the speaker's attitude; rather, they are genuinely amused by the professor's comment.

The literal meaning of the statement is a self-comparison to a degraded version of a pop star, while the implied meaning is a humorous self-acknowledgment, possibly to express modesty or wit.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, no significant changes are needed. The conclusion that the statement is sarcastic is supported by the use of the hashtag #sarcasm, indicating that the statement is meant to be humorous rather than taken at face value.

"Oh how I love working in Baltimore #not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is using sarcasm, implied by the hashtag "#not," to indicate that they do not, in fact, enjoy working in Baltimore. This suggests dissatisfaction or frustration with their work environment or location.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely has negative feelings toward their work situation in Baltimore. They find it perhaps unpleasant or unsatisfying enough to express their discontent publicly on Twitter.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, in this instance, the speaker’s implication and their actual thoughts align. The sarcasm directly conveys their negative sentiment.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is using sarcastic language to pretend initially to express love for working in Baltimore, only to then contradict that with "#not." This suggests that their real attitude is negative rather than positive as the initial part of the statement might suggest.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Oh how I love working in Baltimore #not" is analyzed as sarcastic. The hashtag "#not" indicates that the speaker is implying the opposite of what the literal meaning states; they actually dislike working in Baltimore. The speaker presupposes that the audience understands the use of sarcasm with the contrasting hashtag. The intent of the speaker seems to be expressing dissatisfaction with their work situation in Baltimore, using sarcasm as a rhetorical device. The polarity of the statement is negative, as the final hashtag negates the preceding positive tone. The pretense lies in the speaker's attitude, pretending to enjoy working in Baltimore while implying the opposite. The literal meaning claims enjoyment, but the implied meaning is dissatisfaction or frustration. The analysis correctly identifies the sarcasm, and there is no need for changes to conclude that the statement is indeed sarcastic.

- **Polarity:** The tone is negative, emphasizing distress with the crying emojis.
- **Pretense:** There is no pretense; the distress seems genuine.
- **Meaning:** The literal statement is about a packed schedule of games, but the implied meaning is that this schedule causes stress or fatigue to the speaker.

**Conclusion:**

The statement is not sarcastic. The genuine distress conveyed by the crying emojis and the straightforward expression of an undesirable situation indicate a lack of sarcasm. The speaker is sincerely overwhelmed and not using irony or sarcasm to express their sentiment.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement is sarcastic. 

The speaker implies that ESPN is promoting a basketball game extensively, despite sarcastically questioning whether there is a game at all. The presupposition is that ESPN, being a major sports network, would normally promote sports events widely. The intent of the speaker seems to be to highlight and criticize the extent of ESPN's promotions, possibly finding them excessive or overwhelming. The use of the hashtag #sarcasm signals the sarcastic intent overtly, confirming the pretense in their feigned ignorance about the game's occurrence.

The polarity of the statement is negative, as it criticizes ESPN for their promotion methods, and the speaker's attitude is sarcastically dismissive. The literal versus implied meaning differs greatly; literally, the speaker expresses uncertainty about a basketball game, but the implied meaning, amplified by the hashtag, is that ESPN's promotion is unmistakably evident.

The preliminary analysis correctly identified these aspects, supporting the conclusion that the statement is sarcastic. The analysis fully aligns with the speaker's intent and expression of sarcasm towards ESPN's promotion practices.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that someone mistakenly thought @MaraAzzurra89 is related to Padoin, perhaps someone known, likely a public figure, and they find this assumption to be humorous or ridiculous.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely finds the situation amusing and considers the identification or assumption as incorrect, implying that it's an obvious or silly mistake to think @MaraAzzurra89 could be Padoin's sister.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts are aligned in suggesting that the idea of @MaraAzzurra89 being Padoin's sister is ridiculous or erroneous, and they are using sarcasm to highlight this point.

Finally, it seems the speaker is pretending to have a humorous attitude toward the conversation by using #SarcasmFail to underline the perceived absurdity of the mistake. They emphasize their disbelief or mockery over the error in a playful way.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**The Implicature**: The speaker implies that the idea of @MaraAzzurra89 being associated with Padoin as a sister is not only incorrect but also laughable, highlighting the mistaken identity with humor.

**The Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted in the conversation that everyone involved knows who Padoin is and that @MaraAzzurra89 is not actually related to him. The statement assumes a familiarity with both parties and that the mix-up is easily spotted and absurd.

**The Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker hopes to convey amusement and disbelief at the situation while teasing the error with the hashtag #SarcasmFail. The intent is to entertain or share a laugh over the error within their social circle or public audience.

**The Polarity**: The tone of the statement is positive, as it is meant to be humorous and light-hearted despite the mocking nature.

**Pretense**: There is pretense in the speaker's attitude as they use sarcasm to point out the mistaken identity in a playful manner, pretending to find humor in what might have been intended or perceived as a serious identification.

**Meaning**: The literal meaning of the statement claims someone genuinely thought @MaraAzzurra89 was Padoin's sister. The implied meaning is that this assumption is so evidently wrong or humorous that it deserves mockery through sarcasm.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is definitely sarcastic. It uses humor and sarcasm to point out the absurdity of the mix-up, and the added hashtag #SarcasmFail reinforces the speaker's disbelief and mockery of the error. The analysis accurately identifies the elements of sarcasm in the statement.

The speaker's intent seems to be to highlight the global nature of public dissent against authority decisions, without inserting personal opinion or bias. The tone is neutral and straightforward, without pretense.

"Watching Alison Jackson's portfolio of work #eurobest2014 seems she's cracked it. Celebrity + stunt = #viral #sarcasm"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that Alison Jackson's success is based on the formulaic combination of involving celebrities in stunts to achieve virality. The use of "#sarcasm" suggests that there is a lack of genuine admiration for this method, indicating that the speaker sees it as a simplistic or predictable approach to creating viral content.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely thinks that while Alison Jackson achieves success through her work, the method by which she does so is not particularly innovative or commendable. The hashtag "#sarcasm" underscores a cynical or critical view of equating success with merely following a straightforward recipe of celebrity appeal and stunts.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's expressed thoughts convey a similar message—that the success attributed to Alison Jackson is not necessarily due to creativity or originality, but rather a tried-and-tested formula of using celebrity and spectacle to garner attention.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is likely using the hashtag "#sarcasm" to indicate that their apparent praise of Alison Jackson cracking a successful formula is not sincere, and they are likely adopting a facade of admiration to critique the predictability of her method.

The speaker is commenting on Alison Jackson's work showcased at Eurobest 2014, implying that her success is achieved through a straightforward, unoriginal formula that combines celebrities and stunts to create viral content. The speaker's use of the hashtag "#sarcasm" indicates a lack of genuine admiration and suggests a critical or cynical view of this approach. Both the implicature and the speaker's direct thoughts align in suggesting that the success is formulaic rather than innovative. The speaker uses sarcasm and pretense to critique what they perceive as a predictable method, instead of showing genuine praise. The polarity of the statement is negative due to the underlying criticism, and there is a clear difference between the literal praise and the implied criticism.

Given the preliminary analysis, the statement is clearly sarcastic. The speaker is not genuinely praising Alison Jackson but is instead ironically highlighting what they perceive as the lack of originality in her approach to creating viral content.

"#Analysis -- #Economic #issues #whip #up #Israelis #in #chocolate #pudding #election."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that economic issues are a significant and possibly controversial topic that is affecting Israelis, likely in the context of an election. The mention of "chocolate pudding" suggests an unexpected or surreal element in the situation which could imply that the election or the issues are not being taken as seriously as expected or alternatively, that there's a chaotic or nonsensical element in the situation.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears to find the situation worth noting or possibly absurd, as they are highlighting the convergence of serious economic issues and the unusual "chocolate pudding" election. This suggests they see humor or irony in how a substantial matter like economics is intertwined with what might sound like a trivial or bizarre phrase like "chocolate pudding."

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
There is alignment between what the speaker implies and thinks. They imply that the situation is serious and perhaps contentious ("Economic issues whip up Israelis") while also hinting at a bizarre or comical twist with "chocolate pudding election." This expression suggests the speaker views the situation as having both serious and ridiculous aspects.

Finally, it does not seem that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their tone implies a combination of concern and amusement about the election dynamics. The inclusion of "chocolate pudding" likely serves to underline a perceived absurdity in how issues are framed or discussed in the context of this election.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis of the statement suggests that the speaker views the situation as a mix of seriousness and absurdity. The phrase "Economic issues whip up Israelis" indicates that economic concerns are indeed stirring significant attention and possibly causing agitation among Israelis in the context of an election. However, the additional term "chocolate pudding election" introduces an element of surrealism or humor, implying that there's something ridiculous or unexpected about the election circumstances.

The implicature here is that the election, while driven by serious economic issues, involves a level of chaos or is not being entirely taken seriously due to the unusual framing with "chocolate pudding." The presuppositions are that economic issues are pivotal in this election and that the term "chocolate pudding" signifies something unexpected. The tone of the statement combines a serious observation with a mocking or amused undertone, suggesting the speaker finds the situation both important and absurd.

The polarity is mixed; it’s neither entirely positive nor negative but rather points toward irony. There appears to be no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are openly highlighting the oddness of the situation.

The literal meaning involves economic issues affecting Israelis during an election, with a bizarre term "chocolate pudding" attached. The implied meaning is that while these economic issues are serious, the election itself has elements that are treated absurdly.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it could be more explicitly highlighted that the term "chocolate pudding" seems intentionally ironic to critique the way the election is being perceived or conducted.

Conclusively, the statement is sarcastic. The use of "chocolate pudding" in the context of economic issues suggests that the speaker is using irony to highlight an incongruity between the gravity of economic topics and the portrayal or conduct of the election.

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; they are genuinely indicating a playful or relaxed demeanor about not following through on a plan or expectation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The tweet reflects a discrepancy between an implied plan to go out to the Boar's Head and the actual situation of the speaker remaining in bed. The speaker suggests a humorous contrast between having a pint and their actual state of relaxation and leisure, which is conveyed through the use of the smiley face. Both the implicature and presuppositions show that going out was likely never the intent, and the speaker is instead content and joking about the idea. The tone of the statement is light-hearted and playful, indicating no serious pretense or negative sentiment. The literal meaning and the implied humor both suggest a sense of enjoyment in choosing not to go out.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it portrays the tweet as a light-hearted acknowledgment of staying in bed rather than pursuing an activity, with no sarcasm present. The statement is not sarcastic; instead, it playfully contrasts expectation and reality in a humorous way.

**Sarcasm Evaluation:**

- **Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker aims to highlight the irony of the situation to the audience, possibly with an underlying tone of schadenfreude.
- **Polarity:** The tone is negative, despite underlying satisfaction or mockery.

"#Malala Yousufzai receives #NobelPeacePrize and #Pakistan ranks in top 10 dangerous countries !!! #irony"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a stark contradiction or a surprising situation in the fact that Malala Yousufzai, a Pakistani activist, receives the Nobel Peace Prize, highlighting peace and education, while simultaneously, Pakistan is considered one of the top 10 most dangerous countries. The use of "#irony" underscores this perceived contradiction.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that it is paradoxical or unexpected for a country associated with significant dangers and issues like Pakistan to have someone awarded one of the most prestigious peace awards. They may find it noteworthy or surprising that despite the country's dangerous status, it can still produce globally recognized agents of peace.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think align in showcasing the perceived contradiction between Malala's recognition for promoting peace and the concurrent report of Pakistan being among the most dangerous countries.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending or adopting a false attitude; rather, they appear genuinely surprised or critical of the irony they perceive in the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature**: The statement implies that there is a contradiction between the achievements of Malala Yousufzai, a renowned Pakistani peace activist, and the status of Pakistan as one of the most dangerous countries in the world. The hashtag "#irony" suggests the speaker finds this comparison unexpected or contradictory.

**Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that awarding a Nobel Peace Prize generally reflects well on the recipient's country; however, the speaker presumes that Pakistan's status as a dangerous country undermines this positive reflection.

**Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to highlight the irony in the situation, pointing out the disparity between Malala's recognition as a peace advocate and Pakistan's negative ranking regarding safety. The speaker's use of the hashtag suggests an attempt to draw attention to or critique this incongruity.

**Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence, emphasized by the use of exclamation marks and the word "irony," carries a negative or critical tone, highlighting the perceived contradiction or absurdity.

**Pretense**: There appears to be no pretense; the speaker seems genuinely struck by the disparity and expresses a genuine perception of irony.

**Meaning**: The literal meaning discusses factual events: Malala winning the Nobel Peace Prize and Pakistan's ranking. The implied meaning, however, suggests a commentary on the contradictory nature of a peace icon emerging from a nation facing significant security challenges.

Revisiting the preliminary analysis, the speaker's highlighting of irony and contradiction suggests a nuanced perspective rather than straightforward surprise or criticism. However, given the stark emphasis on irony and contradiction without any praise or nuance, the statement serves as a critique more than just a simple observation, employing sarcasm.

Ultimately, this statement is sarcastic, as it uses irony to critique the juxtaposition between Malala's recognition and Pakistan's global reputation for danger.

"Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top UNLESS YOU'RE SKINNY #Shade #Sarcasm #TheMoreYouKnow"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies a criticism or mockery directed towards individuals who are skinny, suggesting that they are not included in the idea of being perfect from bottom to top. The inclusion of hashtags #Shade and #Sarcasm suggests that the statement is meant to be taken humorously or ironically, rather than genuinely.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that societal standards of beauty and perfection are flawed, particularly in the expectation or preference for certain body types, possibly overvaluing being skinny. By using sarcasm, they might be highlighting the absurdity or unfairness of those standards.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they seem to align. The speaker is using sarcasm to imply that the societal notion of perfection is exclusionary and perhaps unrealistic, which reflects their thoughts on the situation as being critical of these beauty standards. 

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is likely pretending to embrace the idea of physical perfection based on body type but using sarcasm to unveil their true critical stance on the matter. The tone suggests they are not genuinely espousing these views but rather highlighting an issue with them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement uses sarcasm to criticize societal beauty standards, particularly those that favor certain body types, like being skinny. By saying "Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top UNLESS YOU'RE SKINNY," the speaker mocks the exclusionary nature of these standards. The use of hashtags like #Shade and #Sarcasm indicates that the statement is not meant to be taken literally but rather as humorous or ironic commentary. The speaker pretends to accept the beauty standard but uses sarcasm to reveal their true critical view on the issue.

In terms of analysis:
- The implicature is that society's notion of perfection excludes skinny people, which is criticized.
- The presupposition is that society has certain standards of beauty that are exclusionary.
- The speaker's intent is to highlight and criticize these flawed standards humorously.
- The polarity is negative, highlighting the exclusion and absurdity of such standards.
- There is pretense in the speaker's attitude as they mockingly uphold societal ideals to point out their absurdity.
- The literal meaning suggests perfection based on body type, while the implied meaning questions and criticizes these standards.

Given this analysis, the statement is sarcastic. It uses irony to communicate a deeper criticism of societal beauty standards.

- The speaker likely thinks that this feature or bug in Chrome is inconvenient or inefficient, as it affects their download experience negatively.

- The speaker's use of sarcasm indicates that what they imply (loving Chrome more) is the opposite of what they actually think (frustration or annoyance with Chrome).

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The tweet highlights an issue the speaker has with Chrome slowing down downloads when a screen saver activates. The speaker implies frustration or annoyance with Chrome rather than actual love for the product. The sarcasm is evident through the use of the hashtag "#sarcasm" and the pretense of having a positive attitude when in reality, the sentiment is negative. The speaker pretends to praise Chrome when, in fact, they are expressing dissatisfaction. The literal statement suggests they love Chrome more, but the implied meaning is one of irritation. 

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it correctly identifies the tweet as sarcastic, as the speaker uses sarcasm to convey their negative feelings about Chrome's behavior. No changes are needed for this analysis, and it is accurate to conclude that the statement is sarcastic.

The speaker's statement is: "but you can't expect us to hire one in only 3 weeks. Who moves that quickly on a coaching search? #sarcasm"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement? 
The speaker implies that the timeframe of three weeks is, in fact, quite a reasonable, perhaps even extended, period to conduct a coaching search. The use of sarcasm suggests they believe the process could, or should, be conducted more swiftly.

- What does the speaker think about the situation? 
The speaker likely thinks that three weeks is ample time to find a coach and is critical of any suggestion or implication that this period is too short. They may also be critiquing decision-makers for their perceived inefficiency or slow pace.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing? 
Yes, they both reflect the sentiment that three weeks is a sufficient amount of time to conduct a coaching search, and possibly criticize the process for being unnecessarily slow.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
With the use of sarcasm, the speaker is pretending to agree that three weeks is too quick for a coaching search, when in reality, they disagree and are possibly frustrated by the inefficiency.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement about the timeframe for hiring a coach is sarcastic. They imply that a three-week period to complete a coaching search is more than reasonable and perhaps longer than necessary. The sarcasm is evident through the rhetorical question and the hashtag "#sarcasm," indicating the speaker's criticism of any perceived inefficiency or delay in the hiring process. The speaker is not genuinely questioning the speed of the process but instead highlighting what they see as excessive slowness. They likely believe that decision-makers should act more quickly and efficiently.

In analyzing the statement:

1. The implicature suggests that the speaker finds the three-week period sufficient and is subtly critiquing any notion that it’s too short.
2. The presupposition is the taken-for-granted idea that typically, a coaching search might take more than three weeks, and this is what's being mocked.
3. The speaker's intent is to express frustration or dissatisfaction with the pace of the hiring process.

The polarity is negative, as the sarcasm implies a critique or dissatisfaction. There's pretense in the speaker's attitude through their use of sarcasm because they say something contrary to what they believe.

Based on this analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic, reflecting frustration or criticism of the situation rather than agreeing with the literal words expressed. No changes are necessary to the preliminary analysis, as it accurately captures the sarcastic nature of the statement.

"So I may have had a 'few' empties to recycle... ♻♻ |I ❤ #craftbeer http://t.co/qlZbtAcmOx"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they have consumed a significant amount of craft beer, as suggested by the "few" empties they have to recycle. The quotation marks around "few" suggest that the number is likely more than just a few, hinting at a playful exaggeration.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the expressed sentiment align in conveying a light-hearted and favorable view towards the consumption of craft beer. The speaker's playful tone suggests they see no issue with having indulged.

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; they appear genuine in expressing their fondness for craft beer and jest about the number of bottles they have to recycle.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature**: The speaker implies that they have consumed a large quantity of craft beer, as indicated by the number of empty bottles that need recycling. The use of quotation marks around "few" suggests that the actual number is significantly larger, serving as a humorous understatement.

**Presuppositions**: It is presupposed that the speaker enjoys drinking craft beer, as evidenced by the heart emoji and the hashtag. There is also an assumption that they frequently consume enough to have a number of empties to recycle.

**Intent of the speaker**: The speaker aims to both humorously acknowledge and share their love for craft beer. They likely want to entertain or connect with an audience who also appreciates craft beer or can relate to the situation. The speaker is an individual who enjoys and takes pride in their craft beer consumption.

**Polarity**: The tone of the statement is positive, as shown by the heart emoji and the playful language.

**Pretense**: There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are genuinely sharing their humorous reflection on their craft beer consumption.

**Meaning**: The literal meaning is that the speaker has a few empty beer bottles to recycle. The implied meaning is that they have consumed a lot more than just a "few" bottles, with "few" being a humorous understatement illustrating their fondness for craft beer.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement's humor and exaggeration align with the characteristics of a light-hearted, honest, and humorous tone rather than sarcasm. The analysis does not indicate any contradiction between the literal and implied meanings that would be typical of sarcasm. Thus, the statement is not sarcastic.

"Anybody using their rights to protest legally gets the law thrown at them. & the ones who do the crimes don't. That's #Irony #NotJustice"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a discrepancy or inconsistency in how the law is being applied. Specifically, they suggest that those who are engaging in legal protests are being unfairly penalized or treated harshly by the legal system, whereas individuals who are committing actual crimes are not being held accountable.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker believes the situation is unjust and ironic. They are critical of the current state of justice, indicating that the application of law is not being done fairly or equitably. The use of hashtags "#Irony" and "#NotJustice" further suggests that they see this situation as contradictory to the principles of justice.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they explicitly state reflect the same viewpoint: criticism of the justice system and the perceived irony in its operation when it comes to protests and crime.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude; their statement comes across as genuine frustration or criticism regarding the situation they are describing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

The statement implies a discrepancy in the legal system's application, where legal protestors face harsh legal treatment while actual criminals seem to evade accountability. The speaker presupposes that the justice system should apply its laws fairly and equitably. Their intent is to criticize and highlight the perceived injustice in how the law is applied, expressing frustration and highlighting irony in the situation. The polarity of the statement is negative, particularly in its concluding hashtag labels, "#Irony #NotJustice," which emphasize criticism of the current legal system.

There is no indication of pretense in the speaker's tone; their frustration appears sincere. The literal meaning of the statement aligns closely with its implied meaning, emphasizing the unfairness in the justice system.

**Reflection and Determination on Sarcasm:**

Considering the analysis, while the statement uses the term "irony," which sometimes suggests sarcasm, the tone reflects sincere frustration and criticism rather than sarcastic humor. The hashtags used seem direct in expressing genuine discontent. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic, but rather a straightforward critique of perceived injustice and legal inconsistencies.

Preliminary analysis of the statement "#Funny #18+ Turn On aquabreeze:||disgustinghotels:||#not all men http://t.co/F4OEPX8uob" suggests the following:

- **Implicature:** The speaker implies a humorous or sarcastic observation by juxtaposing something typically appealing as a "turn on" with something undesirable like "disgustinghotels." The phrase "#not all men" might imply a critique about generalizations or stereotypes.
  
- **Presuppositions:** The statement takes for granted that the audience understands the contrast between the terms used and gets the underlying humor.

- **Speaker's Intent:** The speaker aims to entertain or critique societal norms using irony or sarcasm, catering to an audience familiar with internet humor and hashtags.

- **Polarity:** The tone is predominantly negative when considering "disgustinghotels" as part of the context, despite the humorous tag "#Funny."

- **Pretense:** There is no pretense; the speaker is direct in their humorous approach.

- **Meaning:** Literarily, the statement lists hashtags and terms without clear connection. Implied meaning, however, indicates humor or satire in comparing appealing and unappealing concepts.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it holds that the statement is sarcastic. The intentional mismatch between "Turn On" and "disgustinghotels" showcases irony, supported by the aligned hashtags that convey humor. The tone intended is likely to critique or poke fun at general perceptions, such as what is considered attractive or typical of certain groups, with "#not all men" reinforcing this critique.

"Who told the #hipsters that #irony was a thing of the Clinton years? Do they not carry history books in used bookstores in #brooklyn?"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that hipsters may be out of touch with certain cultural trends or historical knowledge, specifically regarding the concept of irony. They suggest that hipsters view irony as something outdated, linked to the Clinton era, when they believe it still has contemporary relevance or isn't limited to that time period.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears to think that hipsters are mistaken or ill-informed about irony, thus implying a level of disbelief or amusement at their perception. They also hint that hipsters should know better, especially since Brooklyn is known for its access to cultural and historical resources like used bookstores.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts suggest that they find it ironic or misguided that hipsters might view irony as outdated. They both point out a contradiction in hipsters' understanding or appreciation for irony, considering Brooklyn's reputation as a place rich in cultural awareness.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending; rather, they seem genuinely bemused or critical of what they see as an oversight or misconception by a group they assume would be more culturally astute.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker implies that hipsters incorrectly believe irony is outdated, specifically tied to the Clinton years, and suggests they should know better due to their access to cultural resources like used bookstores in Brooklyn. The speaker seems to genuinely find this mistaken belief amusing or critical, without pretense. The tone is negative, considering the criticism of hipsters’ perceived ignorance regarding irony’s contemporary relevance. The literal meaning is questioning hipsters' understanding of irony, while the implied meaning highlights a contradiction in their perceived cultural awareness. There's no pretense in the attitude; the speaker genuinely questions the hipsters' cultural insight.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is sarcastic. The speaker uses irony to point out what they perceive as hipsters' ironic misunderstanding of irony itself, emphasizing the contradiction and aiming to highlight this to an audience familiar with cultural popular trends like those in Brooklyn.

The speaker's tweet states: "I guess Paul didn't have buns, hon. #EatenAlive #not @Discovery"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that Paul was expected to have something (referred to as "buns") which he lacked or failed to showcase. The use of the hashtag "#EatenAlive" and the word "not" suggests a scenario related (possibly jokingly) to a failed promise or stunt—there could be a reference to a Discovery channel event or show where expectations were not met.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to be mocking or making a sarcastic comment about expectations not being met. The use of informal language "hon" and the hashtag suggest a light-hearted or humorous attitude, perhaps ridiculing the situation or expressing disappointment in a sarcastic manner.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both imply that there was an expectation for Paul (or an event involving him) that was not fulfilled, possibly referencing a situation associated with Discovery.

The speaker appears to be adopting a sarcastic or mocking attitude towards the situation, which suggests they might not be genuinely upset but are humorously pointing out the discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered. Therefore, the speaker seems to be pretending to be more amused or sarcastic than genuinely frustrated.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's tweet involves a reference to an expectation about "Paul" having "buns," which wasn't met. The use of "#EatenAlive" and "not" indicates a likely sarcastic tone around a Discovery Channel event or stunt that didn't meet expectations. The speaker implies that there was anticipation for something (likely outlandish or dramatic) that didn't happen as expected. This is further supported by the light-hearted and mocking tone with terms like "hon," suggesting more humor than genuine disappointment. The speaker seems to be playfully mocking the gap between what was anticipated and what actually occurred, thus pretending to be amused rather than truly frustrated.

Upon reflection on the preliminary analysis, it's clear that the statement is intended to be sarcastic. The speaker uses humor to point out the discrepancy between expectations and reality, employing language and hashtags that accentuate their playful, mocking stance rather than conveying genuine upset. Therefore, the statement is sarcastic.

"Amar Singh gives A+ rating to the Modi govt but Arun #Shourie says more is said than done in present govt #Irony #Politics"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a contradiction or irony in the perspectives of two different individuals, Amar Singh and Arun Shourie, regarding the performance of the Modi government. One (Amar Singh) is highly favorable, while the other (Arun Shourie) is critical.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The use of "#Irony #Politics" suggests that the speaker finds the situation amusing or noteworthy due to the contrasting views. They likely think there is an interesting dynamic at play with how different politicians or public figures perceive the government's performance.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the speaker implies the irony of the situation and, by highlighting it, also conveys their own perception of the irony. Both underscore the contradiction between the positive rating from Amar Singh and the more critical view from Arun Shourie.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker doesn't seem to be pretending; they genuinely appear to find the opposition between the two views ironic and noteworthy in the context of politics.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**The Implicature:** The speaker implies a contrast or irony in the differing opinions about the Modi government from Amar Singh and Arun Shourie. Amar Singh's positive rating and Arun Shourie's criticism highlight a significant disparity in views.

**The Presuppositions:** The presupposition is that there are multiple valid opinions about the Modi government's performance and that these opinions are so different they lead to irony.

**The Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker, likely someone observing the political discourse, aims to highlight the contrast between favorable and critical assessments of the government, emphasizing the irony in these opposing views.

**The Polarity:** The tone is neutral to negative, as the speaker points out an ironic situation rather than expressing direct positivity or negativity about the government.

**Pretense:** There is no pretense; the speaker genuinely finds the situation ironic and wants to bring it to the audience's attention.

**Meaning:** Literally, the statement reports two contrasting opinions. Implied is that the differing views are ironic due to their stark contrast, especially given the political figures involved.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is likely sarcastic. The speaker uses humor to highlight the contradiction between Amar Singh's praise and Arun Shourie's criticism, suggesting the audience should question the effectiveness of the Modi government despite Amar Singh's positive rating. The use of "#Irony" strongly indicates sarcasm aimed at questioning the sincerity or accuracy of the positive assessment.

"Nothing says nature like the relentless sound of AM commuter traffic #fthunter #AMdogfun #not@allpeaceful"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is implying that the sound of commuter traffic in the morning is ironically uncharacteristic of what one would typically associate with a natural, peaceful environment. This is evident in the sarcastic use of the phrase "nothing says nature."

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely finds the sound of morning commuter traffic disruptive and not conducive to a peaceful or enjoyable time in nature. The hashtags #fthunter and #AMdogfun suggest they might be engaging in an activity like dog walking or hunting that ideally takes place in a serene natural setting. The hashtag #not@allpeaceful reinforces the speaker's perception of the traffic noise as a disturbance.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies (through sarcasm about the appreciation of nature) and what they explicitly think (as evidenced by the supporting hashtags) both indicate a negative assessment of the situation due to the intrusive sound of traffic.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm to convey their attitude, which is common in expressing frustration or displeasure humorously. They are not pretending to have a different attitude; rather, they are masking their true feelings in a light-hearted or satirical manner.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis accurately interprets the speaker's use of sarcasm to express their displeasure with the sound of morning commuter traffic, which is contrary to the peaceful or natural environment they expected. 

The analysis identifies the following:
- **Implicature**: The speaker implies that the sound of traffic is the opposite of what one would associate with nature.
- **Presuppositions**: The speaker assumes that nature should be peaceful, contrasting with the noise of traffic.
- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker intends to humorously highlight the irony and express dissatisfaction with the intrusive noise.
- **Polarity**: The final tone is negative, emphasizing disturbance.
- **Pretense**: The sarcasm is used as a rhetorical device to highlight their discomfort, not pretending to enjoy the sound.

The literal meaning suggests that traffic aligns with nature, whereas the implied meaning reveals the speaker's ironic dissatisfaction.

Given the above points and in light of the preliminary analysis, which doesn't require any change, the statement is indeed sarcastic, using humor to express frustration over the intrusive commuter traffic noise.

"Hearing gun shots when I first wake up makes me feel like I'm in Compton. What a wonderful way to wake up. ❤ #sarcasm #imscared"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that their environment is unsafe, as hearing gunshots is not a usual or desired way to wake up. The mention of Compton—often stereotyped in popular culture as associated with crime—further underscores the idea of a dangerous or unsettling setting.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker is unhappy and frightened about waking up to gunshots, as indicated by the hashtag #imscared and the use of sarcasm. They are expressing discomfort and concern regarding their surroundings.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts convey the message of feeling unsafe and disturbed by gunshots in their environment.

Finally, the speaker is definitely using sarcasm in their statement, which suggests they're pretending to have a certain attitude—mock cheerfulness ("What a wonderful way to wake up")—to emphasize the opposite: their actual fear and discomfort about the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Hearing gun shots when I first wake up makes me feel like I'm in Compton. What a wonderful way to wake up. ❤ #sarcasm #imscared" is an expression by the speaker indicating discomfort and fear due to being in an unsafe environment. The reference to Compton suggests an association with crime and danger, alluding to the idea of waking up in an unsettling setting.

**Implicature**: The statement implies that the speaker's environment is unsafe, as they don't genuinely find waking up to gunshots to be wonderful, despite the literal use of that word.

**Presuppositions**: It is presupposed that hearing gunshots is not a typical or desired experience for waking up, nor is it expected in a safe environment.

**Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker intends to express their dissatisfaction and fear about their current surroundings. By using sarcasm and referring to a dangerous stereotype associated with Compton, they aim to highlight their sense of vulnerability.

**Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence is negative, as the so-called "wonderful way to wake up" is sarcastic.

**Pretense**: There is pretense in the attitude, as the speaker feigns cheerfulness to underscore their true feelings of fear and discomfort.

**Meaning**: The literal meaning of the statement—that waking up to gunshots is wonderful—is the opposite of the implied meaning. The speaker uses sarcasm to emphasize how undesirable and frightening they find the situation.

In conclusion, the preliminary analysis correctly identifies the statement as sarcastic. The literal meaning contrasts sharply with the speaker's true feelings, clearly communicated through the sarcastic tone and hashtags indicating fear.

"Ladies wouldn't use that language. But I guess you are not one."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that using certain language is not characteristic of a "lady," suggesting that the language and behavior being referred to is inappropriate or unrefined according to specific societal standards.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**The Implicature**: The speaker is implying that the person they are addressing is not behaving like a "lady" due to their language, which is considered inappropriate or unrefined by the speaker's standards.

**The Presuppositions**: It is presupposed that there is a societal standard of what language is appropriate for a "lady" to use, and that the addressed person has failed to meet this standard.

**The Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to criticize and perhaps shame the addressed individual for their language, highlighting a perceived failure to conform to societal norms of "ladylike" behavior.

**The Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence is negative, as it conveys criticism and judgement.

**Pretense**: There seems to be no pretense; the speaker's attitude seems genuine and critical.

**Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests that the addressed person is not a "lady," while the implied meaning criticizes their language and questions their adherence to expected societal behavior.

"not you, you're on pain medications 😂"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the person they are addressing, @kaylakrebs5, is not in a situation to participate or engage in something, likely because the pain medications might impair their ability to do so effectively.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to think it's humorous that @kaylakrebs5 would be considered in whatever context they're implying, likely due to the effects of the pain medications.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts align in suggesting that being on pain medications is a humorous or disqualifying factor in this context.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude; their use of the laughing emoji suggests they genuinely find the situation amusing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Preliminary Analysis Summary:**

The statement from @kaylakrebs5 includes an implicit understanding that being on pain medications is viewed humorously or as a disqualification from engaging in an undisclosed activity. The presupposition is that @kaylakrebs5's current circumstances (being on pain medications) are noteworthy enough to exclude them from some consideration. The intent of the speaker seems to be to amuse both the audience (which includes @kaylakrebs5) and themselves, as indicated by the laughing emoji. There is no apparent pretense in the speaker's expression of amusement, indicating they genuinely find the situation funny. The tone is positive due to the use of the emoji and the light-hearted nature of the comment.

**Analysis Reflection:**

The statement's literal meaning suggests that @kaylakrebs5 is on pain medications, and therefore, shouldn't be considered for something. The implied meaning, however, is that the speaker finds humor in @kaylakrebs5's potential involvement, given their current state. There seems to be no change needed in the preliminary analysis as it adequately captures the implied humor.

**Is the Statement Sarcastic?**

While there is a humorous tone, the statement does not appear to be sarcastic. Sarcasm typically involves saying the opposite of what one means to mock or convey contempt, whereas this statement seems to genuinely find humor in the situation without any underlying contempt or contradiction between literal and implied meanings. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is an ironic situation where a league game is rescheduled due to a cup final, possibly suggesting that it's surprising or unexpected that the Petrofac Cup, which might be considered less prestigious, is affecting the scheduling of a league game.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?

  Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think both point towards the irony and humor in the situation. They both suggest that the change in schedule seems unexpected or amusing due to the perceived importance (or lack thereof) of the Petrofac Cup.

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude. Their use of "#irony" suggests they genuinely find the scenario humorous or ironic, rather than expressing frustration or other negative feelings.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker is highlighting the unexpected and humorous nature of a league game being rescheduled for the Petrofac Cup final. There's an implication that the Petrofac Cup, seen as less prestigious, is ironically causing a shift in the schedule of what may be assumed a more significant league match. The speaker intends to draw attention to this irony in a light-hearted manner, as indicated by the use of "#irony." The polarity of the statement is neutral to positive, focusing more on the amusing aspect rather than any negative connotation. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they genuinely seem amused by the situation.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. While the speaker literally states the fact about the rescheduling, the use of irony implies a disbelief or mockery of the situation, suggesting that it is ridiculous that a league game is moved due to a less prestigious tournament.

The speaker tweeted: "@SusanCalman @ClaireofThorpe Yet no "dog in the manger" that actually makes it a dog in a manger story #Irony"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is an absence of an essential element (the "dog in the manger") in a situation that is being described as a "dog in the manger story," which constitutes an irony. The classic "dog in the manger" fable involves a dog lying in a manger, preventing other animals from accessing food, yet the dog itself doesn't use the manger. This suggests a contradiction or missing element in the current situation being alluded to.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to view the situation as ironic or perhaps not genuinely aligned with what a "dog in the manger story" traditionally represents. They find humor or absurdity in the fact that the central character (or concept) in the supposed scenario is missing.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both imply and think that there is irony in labeling something as akin to a "dog in the manger" story when the central, defining element (the dog) is absent. They highlight a disconnect or inconsistency in the narrative being presented.

The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; their use of irony directly reflects their genuine perception of the situation as inconsistent or paradoxical.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker addresses a situation being likened to a "dog in the manger" scenario but points out the absence of the defining element - the dog. They imply that it's ironic to call it a "dog in the manger story" when the primary character is missing. The speaker finds humor in this inconsistency, seeing it as not aligning with the traditional story. There's no pretense in their attitude; they genuinely view the situation as paradoxical. The statement’s tone has a negative polarity due to the irony expressed.

The analysis highlights that the speaker's statement is intended to point out irony, implying something different from what is literally stated. This qualifies as sarcasm because the literal meaning contrasts with what is implied – a classic trait of sarcastic remarks. The use of "#Irony" further underscores the sarcasm, as it draws attention to the lack of alignment between expectation and reality in the situation described. Thus, the statement is sarcastic.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there has been an unusually high number of single men purchasing smoothies at their establishment on that particular day.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to express a light-hearted or amused observation about the trend in their customer base for the day, suggesting it's notable or unusual enough to create a playful 'theme day' around it.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts converge on the idea that there is a noticeable trend of single men buying smoothies, and the speaker finds this situation interesting or amusing.

Regarding the attitude, the speaker does not appear to be pretending. The statement comes across as genuine amazement or entertainment rather than hiding or feigning any particular emotion or attitude.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement focuses on the unexpected observation that all of the speaker's customers on that day have been single men, which they humorously declare as "Single men get a smoothie" day. The tone is amused and playful, not masked by any pretense. 

**The Implicature:** The speaker implies that the presence of single men buying smoothies is unusual or perhaps amusingly abundant enough to warrant commentary. It suggests a comical observation rather than a typical business approach.

**The Presuppositions:** The speaker assumes the audience understands their intention to humorously acknowledge the day’s customer trend. It’s also taken for granted that listeners will find the situation as unusual or funny as the speaker does.

**The Intent:** The speaker, likely a business owner or employee, aims to share and possibly amuse others with their observation of the day's clientele being predominantly single men.

**The Polarity:** The tone is largely positive, with an element of amusement.

**Pretense:** There is no pretense; the speaker seems genuinely entertained by the occurrence.

**Meaning:** The literal statement details an observation of customer demographics for the day, while the implied meaning emphasizes the humor in the unusual predominance of single men the speaker encountered.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement is not sarcastic. The humor in the situation aligns with the speaker's genuine reaction, and there is no contradiction between expressed and intended meaning. The statement has a playful tone rather than one intended to convey sarcasm.

The statement "Shitty drivers are always fun. #not" implies sarcasm towards the situation of encountering bad drivers.

- **What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?**
  The speaker implies that encountering "shitty drivers" is not enjoyable or fun, despite the initial positive-sounding phrase. The use of sarcasm, highlighted by the hashtag #not, indicates the speaker finds dealing with bad drivers unpleasant or frustrating.

- **What does the speaker think about the situation?**
  The speaker thinks that dealing with bad drivers is problematic and not enjoyable. By using sarcasm, they are expressing dissatisfaction or annoyance with the situation.

- **Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?**
  Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think align; they are using sarcasm to convey their true negative feelings about bad drivers.

Finally, the speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; they are clearly using sarcasm to express their real annoyance with the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Shitty drivers are always fun. #not" is an example of sarcasm. The speaker implies the opposite of the literal meaning; they do not find bad drivers enjoyable. The presupposition is that encountering bad drivers is commonly acknowledged as a negative experience, taken for granted by most people. The speaker intends to express their frustration and annoyance, using sarcasm to emphasize their displeasure. The polarity of the sentence is negative, conveyed by the phrase "shitty drivers" and underscored by "#not." There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they overtly use sarcasm to denote their genuine annoyance.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, nothing should be changed as it correctly identifies the sarcasm in the speaker's statement, aligning with the analysis of implicature, presuppositions, intent, polarity, pretense, and the contrast between literal and implied meaning. The statement is indeed sarcastic.

The tweet states: "we are all the same race, HUMAN the only race supported by the Human Genome Project @CalFreedomMom @RBRNetwork1 @msnbc @CNN @dkuck15138"

- The speaker implies that there is only one race—the human race—and that this notion is scientifically supported by the Human Genome Project.
- The speaker seems to believe in the unity and equality of all people by emphasizing that there is only one race, thus advocating against racism or any form of racial discrimination.
- Yes, what the speaker implies (that there is scientific support for the idea that all humans are the same race) and what the speaker thinks (a belief in human equality and unity) are aligned and saying the same thing.
- It does not appear that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. They seem genuinely to believe in the concept of human equality.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis of the tweet identifies several components:

1. **Implicature**: The tweet implies that all humans belong to one singular race, which is scientifically recognized by the Human Genome Project.
   
2. **Presuppositions**: The speaker presupposes that the Human Genome Project supports the idea that humans are all one race, thus endorsing human equality and unity.

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to promote the idea of racial equality and is likely addressing an audience who is aware of discussions around racial issues.

4. **Polarity**: The statement carries a positive tone, as it advocates for unity and equality.

5. **Pretense**: There is no apparent pretense in the speaker’s attitude; the speaker seems sincere in promoting the message of equality.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning aligns with the implied meaning; the speaker conveys a belief in the scientific and moral view of human equality.

Reflecting on the analysis, the tweet is direct and supports the idea that the concept of different human races is invalid, promoting the unity of all people. There appears to be no sarcasm in the statement. The speaker genuinely believes in the equality and unity of the human race as one. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

The tweet states: "I wonder what triggered the anxiety? #sarcasm"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the cause of the anxiety should be obvious, suggesting that it is something prevalent or well-known in the context they are referring to. By using sarcasm, they are indicating that there's no real curiosity or uncertainty about the cause; rather, it's something quite apparent.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that the situation is exaggerated or overly discussed. They may be frustrated or annoyed that the cause of anxiety is being questioned or that its source isn't recognized as obvious. 

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts suggest that they find the situation obvious and perhaps tiresome. The sarcasm underlines a belief that the anxiety's trigger should be clear to others as it is to them.

Finally, the speaker is indeed pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation; they are feigning ignorance or curiosity when they actually hold a different view—that the cause is clear to them and should be to others as well. This feigned attitude is a classic use of sarcasm to convey their true feelings indirectly.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis suggests that the speaker is using sarcasm to imply that the cause of anxiety should be obvious without actually stating it directly. The presupposition is that the cause is clear to both the speaker and the audience, perhaps hinting at something currently prevalent or widely discussed. The speaker seems to be frustrated or annoyed, possibly feeling that the matter is over-discussed or that people should recognize the obvious cause, which aligns with pretending ignorance or curiosity through sarcasm.

Analyzing the statement:
- The implicature is that the speaker believes the trigger for the anxiety is clearly known.
- The presupposition is that the audience should know what the speaker refers to.
- The speaker's intent is likely to highlight the obviousness of the situation and possibly express annoyance or frustration.
- The polarity of the statement is negative, given the sarcastic tone.
- There is pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they are not genuinely questioning but instead making a point about the transparency of the anxiety's cause.
- The literal meaning is a genuine inquiry into what caused anxiety, while the implied meaning is that the cause is obvious and doesn't need questioning.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, everything aligns to label the statement as sarcastic. The speaker uses sarcasm to indirectly express that the anxiety's cause should be evident without needing to articulate it, emphasizing their perception that it is clear to both themselves and others.

The statement is: "Christmas this Christmas that FOH its just a day people !! get a grip and sit down nd chow some Mopani worms"

- The speaker implies that people are excessively focused on and making too much fuss about Christmas, which they perceive as just another day.
- The speaker thinks that the hype and attention given to Christmas are unnecessary and possibly overblown. They seem to suggest a more laid-back approach, offering an unconventional suggestion to 'chow some Mopani worms.'
- What the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are aligned in their message. They both convey a sense of trivializing the importance of Christmas and advocating for a calm and grounded perspective.

It doesn't appear that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude; rather, they seem genuine in expressing a dismissive view towards the holiday's perceived importance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement expresses a dismissive attitude towards Christmas, suggesting that the holiday is excessively emphasized and is ultimately just another day. The speaker advocates for a relaxed approach, mocking the holiday's significance by suggesting an unusual activity – eating Mopani worms – which is culturally specific and might be humorously intended.

**Analysis of Sarcasm in Statement:**

- **Implicature:** The speaker implies that the attention and fuss about Christmas are unwarranted. They believe it's an overhyped holiday and suggest a mundane activity as an alternative.
- **Presuppositions:** The speaker takes for granted that people generally consider Christmas to be a significant and special holiday.
- **Intent:** The speaker's intent is likely to downplay or trivialize the importance of Christmas and possibly provoke a reaction by suggesting an unconventional activity like eating Mopani worms.
- **Polarity:** The tone of the statement is negative, given the dismissive language used ("FOH," "get a grip").
- **Pretense:** There does not appear to be pretense in the speaker's attitude; they seem genuinely dismissive rather than pretending to hold this view.
- **Meaning:** The literal meaning dismisses Christmas as 'just a day,' while the implied meaning suggests that people should reconsider the importance they place on the holiday and not take it so seriously.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement does not exhibit clear elements of sarcasm. The speaker genuinely seems to hold a dismissive view towards the attention Christmas receives, and there is no stark contrast between the literal and implied meanings that would suggest sarcasm. Therefore, based on the analysis, the statement is more likely to be a genuine expression of the speaker's attitude rather than sarcastic.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that despite the serious nature of the cop having prior misconduct charges, it seems to be overlooked or not considered a problem by some people or authorities involved.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker thinks that it is not acceptable for a cop with prior misconduct charges to be in a position where they can continue such behavior. They are critical of the attitude that seems to dismiss these charges as unimportant.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, the speaker implies criticism through sarcasm and directly communicates disapproval of overlooking prior misconduct charges against the cop.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is not pretending; they are using sarcasm to express genuine criticism and disapproval of the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement implies criticism of a situation where a cop with prior misconduct charges is seemingly allowed to continue their role without consequence. The use of "#sarcasm" explicitly signals that the apparent acceptance of the situation is not genuine but sarcastic. The speaker presupposes that audiences recognize the serious implications of a cop having misconduct charges and that such behavior should not be overlooked. The intent of the speaker is to highlight the absurdity of the situation and criticize the authorities or individuals involved who might be downplaying the seriousness of the cop's prior misconduct. 

The polarity of the statement is negative, as it conveys disapproval and criticism. There is pretense in the speaker's attitude as they pretend to be okay with the situation when, in reality, they strongly disagree with it.

The literal meaning of the statement suggests an acceptance of the situation, while the implied meaning, emphasized by the hashtag "#sarcasm," indicates strong disapproval and criticism.

Upon reflection, the preliminary analysis accurately captures the sarcastic nature of the statement. The speaker is using sarcasm as a rhetorical device to emphasize their genuine criticism of the situation, confirming that the statement is indeed sarcastic.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

The preliminary analysis indicates that the speaker's statement implies a dedication to the authenticity and community-oriented nature of the music in question.

"So ill. It actually hurts to breathe. Still that nice long walk to the station did me the world of good #not"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they are very sick, to the point where even breathing is painful. They also suggest that a long walk to the station was not beneficial to their health, despite what one might typically expect or traditionally say.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker clearly feels unwell and is likely expressing frustration or sarcasm about having to take a walk when they're already in pain. The use of '#not' indicates that they genuinely believe the walk was not beneficial.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the belief of the speaker align with expressing dissatisfaction and sarcasm regarding the walk. They both convey that the walk did not improve their condition and it was not a positive experience.

Finally, the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation, as they use sarcasm to convey their true feelings about the walk not doing them 'the world of good.'
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis suggests that the speaker, who is clearly unwell and in pain while breathing, is using sarcasm to express their dissatisfaction with having to walk to the station. The hashtag '#not' explicitly indicates that contrary to common belief, the walk did not benefit them, thus confirming their negative sentiment. The literal meaning of the statement, which suggests that the walk was beneficial, is contradicted by the implied meaning that it was not. The speaker's intent is to communicate dissatisfaction and discontent with their situation through sarcasm. The use of sarcasm allows the speaker to underscore their true feelings of frustration, indicating a pretense of finding positivity in the walk. 

The statement is indeed sarcastic, as the speaker's true feelings are opposite to what they are expressing in a literal sense.

The statement is: "@Salon dualistic, as in good and evil? Right, because that doesn't apply to the real world.... #sarcasm #OrcsLive"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that the concept of dualism, or categorizing things as good versus evil, is overly simplistic and not applicable to the complexities of the real world.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker appears to be critical or dismissive of the idea that viewing situations in such binary terms is relevant or useful in real-world scenarios, indicating that real-life issues are more nuanced than a simple good versus evil dichotomy.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts convey skepticism or criticism toward dualistic thinking, suggesting it is not sufficient to describe real-world situations.

Finally, the use of sarcasm and hashtags indicates that the speaker is not pretending but rather openly expressing their critical attitude toward the notion of dualism in real-world contexts.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "@Salon dualistic, as in good and evil? Right, because that doesn't apply to the real world.... #sarcasm #OrcsLive" implies that the speaker believes the concept of viewing things as either good or evil is simplistic and not applicable to real-world complexities. The speaker expresses a critical stance, asserting that real-world situations are more nuanced than a simple binary of good versus evil.

The implicature is that dualistic thinking is inadequate for understanding complex real-world issues. The presupposition is that such thinking is commonly considered, but the speaker dismisses this notion. The intent of the speaker is to critique and mock the idea that dualistic thinking is sufficient, targeting those who might support this simplistic viewpoint. The polarity is negative, and the use of hashtags, particularly #sarcasm, signals the speaker's open critical attitude, lacking pretense.

The literal meaning is a statement about dualism not applying to reality, while the implied meaning is a sarcastic dismissal of dualism's relevance to complex issues. The speaker's critical attitude and overt sarcasm, indicated by the hashtags, strengthen the sarcastic tone of the statement.

The statement is indeed sarcastic, as the speaker uses sarcasm to mock the idea of applying dualistic thinking to real-world situations. The analysis correctly identifies the sarcasm, as indicated by the use of hashtags and the speaker's critical attitude. No changes are needed to the preliminary analysis.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that something related to "www.MonsterMMORPG.com" has not been observed or noticed in a certain context or possibly for a certain period of time. The use of hashtags and the link suggest an attempt to attract attention or initiate engagement with the content associated with MonsterMMORPG.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker may believe that the situation warrants promotion or attention, as indicated by the call to follow the associated Twitter handle and the provision of a link. The hashtags indicate an emphasis on certain topics or keywords that they want to highlight or be searchable.

Finally, the speaker's attitude is not explicitly clear as ironic or deceiving. The primary aim seems promotional rather than adopting a specific pretense or sarcasm. The presence of hashtags suggests standard social media tactics to increase visibility rather than any ironic statement.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement appears to promote "www.MonsterMMORPG.com" by suggesting that something on the site hasn't been seen for some time. The use of hashtags and a link indicates a push for engagement, such as visiting the site or following the related Twitter account. The speaker's intent is promotional, not sarcastic. Implicature suggests something notable hasn't recently been observed, while presuppositions highlight that the speaker believes it's worth sharing. The polarity isn't clearly positive or negative but seems neutral, focusing on visibility rather than critique or irony. There is no evident pretense; the literal and implied meanings align with a straightforward call for attention. 

In summary, the statement is strategic in its promotion and lacks sarcasm. The analysis should focus on its clear intent of engagement rather than interpreting it as sarcastic.

The statement is: "~I'm not closed-minded, I'm just dogmatic~ #sarcasm #contradictions"

- The speaker implies that there is no real difference between being closed-minded and being dogmatic, suggesting that both involve a rigid adherence to one's own beliefs or ideas without being open to others' perspectives.
- The speaker seems to find the situation amusing or frustrating, using sarcasm to highlight the contradiction in claiming not to be closed-minded while also admitting to being dogmatic.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. They use sarcasm to underline the contradiction they perceive in people who claim not to be closed-minded but display dogmatic behavior.
- The speaker is indeed pretending to have a certain attitude, as indicated by their use of sarcasm. They are not genuinely justifying or excusing dogmatism; instead, they are mocking the notion that dogmatism is different from being closed-minded.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement “~I'm not closed-minded, I'm just dogmatic~ #sarcasm #contradictions” utilizes sarcasm to highlight the contradiction between claiming not to be closed-minded while admitting to being dogmatic. 

1. **Implicature**: The speaker implies that being dogmatic is essentially the same as being closed-minded, as both involve inflexibility and a lack of openness to other viewpoints.

2. **Presuppositions**: The tweet assumes familiarity with the concepts of closed-mindedness and dogmatism and expects the audience to understand the irony presented in the claim.

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to mock or criticize the idea that dogmatism is a more acceptable form of rigid thought than closed-mindedness. The use of hashtags like #sarcasm and #contradictions further emphasizes their intent to point out the inconsistency.

4. **Polarity**: The tone is negative, as it criticizes the contradiction and mocks the attempt to differentiate between being closed-minded and dogmatic.

5. **Pretense**: There is pretense in the speaker's attitude; they pretend to justify dogmatism while intending to do the opposite by using sarcasm.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests a distinction between closed-mindedness and dogmatism, whereas the implied meaning highlights the absurdity of that distinction, suggesting they are essentially the same.

The preliminary analysis correctly identifies the sarcasm in the statement, as well as the speaker's intent to mock the contradiction inherent in the claim. The statement is unequivocally sarcastic. The use of hashtags also reinforces the sarcastic tone, making it clear that the speaker is not seriously differentiating between closed-mindedness and dogmatism but rather highlighting their similarities in a critical manner.

"Blount also out. You would think this could be the game that White gets some action. I guess not."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that with Blount being out, it would be expected or logical for White to have the opportunity to play or participate more in the game.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to be disappointed or frustrated that White is not getting the opportunity to participate more in the game, despite the absence of Blount.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think suggest that White should logically have more involvement in the game due to Blount's absence, but, for some unspecified reason, that is not happening.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude. Their disappointment or frustration seems genuine regarding the situation where White is not getting the expected opportunity.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement by the speaker implies that with Blount being out, it is logical and expected that White would have an opportunity to play more in the game. However, the speaker notes with disappointment or frustration that this is not happening. The analysis indicates that both the implied message and what the speaker thinks align with the expectation that White should have more involvement due to Blount's absence. The speaker seems to genuinely express disappointment without any pretense.

Upon further reflection, the analysis of the implicature and presuppositions are correct, as it is taken for granted that someone else would normally step up in Blount's absence, presumably White. The intent appears to be to highlight a situation in which expectations are not met, likely to express dissatisfaction or criticize the decision-making regarding game participation. The final sentence carries a negative tone, reflecting disappointment.

There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; the speaker is being straightforward in their commentary. The literal meaning is questioning why White isn't playing more, while the implied meaning is that the speaker believes it is a poor decision. Since there's no irony or contradiction in what is stated and what is intended, the statement is not sarcastic.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?  
The speaker implies that those who are supposed to cover WVHS (West Virginia High School) basketball games are not doing their job properly, as they seem to have missed reporting on an exciting and close game.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?  
The speaker appears to be frustrated or disappointed with the lack of coverage for the WVHS basketball games, especially given the thrilling nature of this particular game that ended with a critical last-second shot.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?  
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts reflect dissatisfaction with the coverage of the WVHS basketball games. They express incredulity or sarcasm towards those responsible for reporting on these events.

The speaker does not seem to be pretending; they are using sarcasm (#NOT) to express genuine frustration about the lack of coverage for the basketball team.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

- **Implicature:** The speaker implies that those tasked with covering WVHS basketball games have failed to report adequately on them, specifically on an exciting event like the Highlanders' thrilling victory.
  
- **Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that WVHS basketball games, particularly those with dramatic outcomes, are newsworthy and expected to be covered.

- **Speaker's Intent:** The speaker aims to criticize or highlight the inadequate coverage of the WVHS basketball games. The intention is to draw attention to the lack of recognition or reporting.

- **Polarity:** The tone of the last sentence is negative due to frustration.

- **Pretense:** There is no pretense; the speaker uses sarcasm to express genuine annoyance.

- **Meaning:** The literal meaning states gratitude towards coverage, but the implied meaning, highlighted by sarcasm (#NOT), indicates the opposite—frustration with the lack of coverage.

**Reflection and Decision:**

The analysis correctly identifies the statement as sarcastic. The use of "#NOT" underscores that the speaker is not genuinely thankful but instead is using irony to criticize the absence of coverage. The sarcasm is evident in the contrast between the literal "thanks" and the frustration expressed, indicating that the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"My mom is the most annoying person I know. I know you're gonna read this since you creep my account, s/o to my mom #idc#istillloveyou"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that their mom frequently checks or monitors their social media account, which they perceive as annoying. Despite this, the speaker is still acknowledging their love for their mom.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks the situation is somewhat frustrating or irritating due to their mom's monitoring. However, they don't hold any real negativity towards her, as indicated by the term of endearment, "shout-out to my mom," and the hashtag #istillloveyou.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and thinks convey a mix of annoyance and affection. They are expressing mild irritation about their mom's actions but ultimately affirm their love.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending. Their expression of annoyance seems genuine, but it is clear they also genuinely care for their mom. The playful tone and the #idc#istillloveyou hashtags suggest they are comfortable openly sharing both feelings.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement acknowledges their mom as the "most annoying person" they know and mentions that their mom frequently monitors their social media account. The tone suggests mild irritation at this behavior, yet the expression of love through "shout-out to my mom" and "#idc#istillloveyou" reveals genuine affection. The speaker's intent seems to be playfully addressing the duality of annoyance and love they feel towards their mom. 

The implicature is that the mom snooping on their account is a repetitive behavior that may be found annoying, yet it's not meant with severe negativity. The presupposition is that the mom will see this post (as she regularly checks the account). The intent is to share a humorous sentiment with followers and possibly communicate directly with the mom in a lighthearted manner.

The polarity in the statement leans toward positive due to the affectionate conclusion despite the initial complaint. There is no significant pretense; the expressed feelings of annoyance and love both seem sincere.

The literal meaning—calling the mom the "most annoying person"—is mitigated by the affectionate hashtags, indicating an underlying fondness. Therefore, the analysis can conclude that the statement, despite having a critical phrase, is not sarcastic. Its primary function is to humorously to express familial love.

  The speaker seems to view the situation humorously or lightheartedly. They don't appear to take the mistake too seriously and find it amusing enough to laugh heartily.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and what the speaker thinks align. The statement suggests amusement about the error, and the speaker's use of "ROFLMAO" confirms they find the situation funny rather than problematic.

Finally, the speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their use of "ROFLMAO" suggests genuine amusement at the situation, rather than feigning a more serious or different type of response.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The tweet uses "ROFLMAO," indicating that the speaker finds the situation amusing or laughable. "OOPS" suggests an error or mistake, but the tone is lighthearted, implying that the mistake is not seen as a serious issue. The speaker is addressing multiple users, perhaps those involved in or aware of the error. The speaker does not seem to be pretending; their attitude appears genuinely amused, not sarcastic.

- **Implicature:** There's an error ("OOPS") that is amusing or not of serious concern.
- **Presuppositions:** An error occurred, and those tagged might relate to or understand it.
- **Intent:** Express amusement, possibly to downplay the seriousness of the error. The speaker might aim to share or bond over a humorous moment with the tagged users.
- **Polarity:** Positive due to the humor and laughter denoted by "ROFLMAO."
- **Pretense:** None detected; the speaker seems genuinely amused.
- **Meaning:** Literally, the speaker is rolling on the floor laughing about a mistake. Implied is that the error is not serious, hence the humor.

The preliminary analysis is largely accurate. The statement isn't sarcastic, as sarcasm typically involves saying the opposite of what one means to convey disdain or criticism. Here, the speaker genuinely finds humor in the situation.

The statement is: "Equal justice for all...unless you are Black during the Obama administration. http://t.co/8ELZkTarZZ via @foxnewspolitics"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that the Obama administration did not deliver equal justice to Black individuals, suggesting a failure or shortcoming in the administration's justice policies or practices towards this demographic.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker appears to think negatively about the Obama administration's handling of justice for Black individuals. By invoking the idea of "equal justice for all" but immediately qualifying it with "unless you are Black," they express a belief that the administration was hypocritical or ineffective in providing equitable justice.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts align in critiquing the Obama administration for purportedly failing to ensure equal justice for Black individuals.

Finally, the speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their statement clearly conveys a critical and disapproving tone regarding the perceived justice issues during Obama's presidency.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To determine whether the statement is sarcastic, let's consider several elements:

1. **Implicature**: The statement implies that there was a lack of equal justice for Black individuals during the Obama administration, despite the purported principle of "equal justice for all."

2. **Presuppositions**: There's an assumption that the Obama administration was expected to deliver equal justice, especially because Obama was the first Black president, and failing to do so is a notable shortcoming.

3. **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to criticize the Obama administration, likely appealing to an audience that is skeptical or critical of Obama, using sarcasm to underscore perceived hypocrisy or failure.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the tweet is negative, as it criticizes perceived disparities in justice during the Obama presidency.

5. **Pretense**: There's pretense in the speaker's attitude; they feign alignment with a universally accepted principle ("equal justice for all") to highlight perceived exceptions, enhancing the sarcastic undertone.

6. **Meaning**: The literal statement suggests a conditional situation that's atypical, which is not what's intended. The implied meaning is a critical jab, suggesting the Obama administration did not uphold equal justice.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement appears sarcastic. The speaker uses the commonly accepted phrase "equal justice for all" in conjunction with the notable exception to imply a criticism of the Obama administration, suggesting it failed its duty without directly stating it. Aligning the negative implications with sarcasm, this critique leverages irony to make its point, making the statement sarcastic.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that Haley, presumably a pet rat, is satisfied or happy with her new hammock. The use of the hashtag #ratsofinstagram suggests that this is a photo or post shared within a community of rat owners or enthusiasts.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely feels pleased or amused by Haley's response to the new hammock. The post conveys a sense of affection and joy derived from observing Haley's reaction.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thought convey a positive sentiment towards Haley's reaction to the new hammock. The speaker implies that the situation is pleasing by stating Haley "approves," and they think this approval is a positive or enjoyable experience.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis highlights several key aspects of the statement about Haley's approval of her new hammock. 

1. **Implicature:** The speaker implies that the pet rat, Haley, is happy with her new hammock, which suggests a positive response. The use of the hashtag #ratsofinstagram implies the context is within a community of rat owners or enthusiasts who would understand and appreciate such content.

2. **Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that Haley is a pet rat, that she has a new hammock, and that she can show "approval" which anthropomorphizes the animal to suggest satisfaction.

3. **Intent of the speaker:** The speaker, likely the pet owner or someone associated with the pet, seeks to express affection for the pet and share a cute or funny interaction with a larger community. The intention is to entertain or engage with others who share a similar interest.

4. **Polarity:** The tone of the statement is positive. The word "approves" conveys a favorable sentiment.

5. **Pretense:** There's no evident pretense; the speaker's attitude appears genuine. The tone is playful and affectionate, consistent with typical social media posts about pets.

6. **Meaning:** The literal meaning is that Haley, presumably a rat, approves of the hammock. The implied meaning is that the rat is content, and the owner is pleased, adding a humorous or charming element by ascribing human traits to an animal. 

Through the analysis, the statement does not appear to be sarcastic. The intentions are genuine and affectionate, without any indication of mockery or contradiction between literal and intended meaning. No changes are needed in the initial analysis, as the sentiment remains consistent with a genuine expression of joy. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

The statement is: "@kiersttt22 yeah I do. But you know there's this thing called an all nighter and apparently I wanna pull one #not"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

- What does the speaker think about the situation?

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "@kiersttt22 yeah I do. But you know there's this thing called an all nighter and apparently I wanna pull one #not" appears sarcastic, largely indicated by the use of the hashtag "#not," which explicitly contradicts any perceived enthusiasm for an "all-nighter."

Implicature: The speaker implies that a task might force them to stay up all night.

Presuppositions: It's assumed that being up all night is undesirable for the speaker and is only something done out of necessity rather than choice or enjoyment.

Intent of the speaker: The speaker is communicating a lack of enthusiasm for an all-nighter and is likely trying to lighten the negativity of the situation with humor.

Polarity: The tone is negative because it expresses an apparent reluctance to stay awake.

Pretense: By using sarcasm, the speaker is pretending to be enthusiastic when they are clearly not.

Meaning: The literal meaning is that the speaker claims they want to stay up all night. The implied meaning, reinforced by the hashtag "#not," is that they actually dislike the idea.

The preliminary analysis rightly identifies sarcasm in the statement, supported by the hashtag "#not," indicating that the speaker finds the concept of pulling an all-nighter undesirable. No changes are needed in this analysis. The statement is indeed sarcastic.

"I bet Joel Embiid is psyched to come back from his injury to play for the worst team in NBA history. #Sarcasm"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that Joel Embiid, a professional basketball player, will not be enthusiastic or excited to return from his injury to play for a team that is being described as historically bad, presumably the Philadelphia 76ers, given the context of his career with them.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker thinks negatively about the team, likely believing they are performing poorly or are incompetent, as they are called "the worst team in NBA history." The use of sarcasm suggests the speaker feels the situation is unfortunate or frustrating.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks align. The sarcastic tone underscores the disparagement of the team's performance and the disbelief that someone would be genuinely excited to rejoin a failing team.

Finally, is the speaker pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation?
The speaker is using sarcasm to pretend to express enthusiasm for Embiid's return. However, the underlying attitude is one of disappointment or criticism concerning the team's performance. The use of sarcasm clarifies that the speaker does not genuinely believe Embiid would be excited about the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement implies dissatisfaction with Joel Embiid's team, suggesting they are performing poorly. The speaker appears critical of the team, indicating they do not genuinely believe Embiid would be enthusiastic about returning. Sarcasm is used to mock the notion that Embiid would be eager to play for what is described as the "worst team in NBA history," likely referring to the Philadelphia 76ers. The speaker is pretending to express excitement but actually conveys frustration or disdain.

The implicature here is that there is a clear contrast between the literal expression of excitement and the implied negativity toward the team's performance. The presupposition is that the team is performing poorly, and the speaker expects the audience to understand this context. The intent is to criticize the team's performance using sarcasm, essentially highlighting their poor standing. The polarity of the sentence is negative due to the disparaging remark about the team. There is pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they are not genuinely expressing enthusiasm but instead highlighting a displeasure with the situation.

Overall, the statement is indeed sarcastic, as the literal meaning of excitement is contrary to the implied criticism of the team's performance.

The speaker implies that receiving the unsolicited explicit picture was unwelcome and possibly offensive. The use of sarcasm indicates that they did not appreciate it despite the literal meaning of "thanks."

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks negatively about the situation. They are expressing annoyance or frustration at having received the picture, which they did not want or ask for.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's actual thoughts align in expressing dissatisfaction and annoyance with the situation.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

- **Implicature:** The speaker implies that the unsolicited explicit picture is unwanted and offensive. By saying "thanks," they mean the opposite, highlighting their disdain.
- **Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that receiving such explicit pictures is generally considered inappropriate unless explicitly agreed upon. The speaker assumes that the audience understands the negative connotation.
- **Intent of the Speaker:** The intention is to convey dissatisfaction and criticize the sender of the picture. The speaker also aims to share their frustration with a broader audience, possibly to garner support or vent.
- **Polarity:** The tone is negative, as indicated by the sarcastic use of "thanks" and the explicit #Sarcasm.
- **Pretense:** Yes, there is pretense in the statement. The speaker pretends to be thankful, but the hashtag clarifies this pretense.
- **Meaning:** The literal meaning suggests gratitude, but the implied meaning is the opposite, showcasing irritation and frustration.

**Changes and Decision on Sarcastic Nature:**

The preliminary analysis accurately identifies the sarcasm due to the stark contrast between the literal and implied meaning, the negative tone, and the explicit declaration of sarcasm. The presence of pretense and the speaker's intention to criticize further support the analysis. Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

The tweet is: "When 'make dua for me bro' turns into an hour long conversation."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that a simple request for a prayer or well-wishing (dua) unexpectedly becomes a much longer interaction, suggesting that there was more to discuss or that the situation was more substantial than initially perceived.
  
- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely views the situation as somewhat unexpected or perhaps humorous, hinting at a transition from a simple interaction into an extensive conversation, possibly implying that it was more exhausting or demanding than anticipated.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, the implication and the speaker's thoughts align in highlighting the surprising nature of a simple request spiraling into a lengthy dialogue, emphasizing an element of unexpectedness or irony.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Based on the preliminary analysis:

- **Implicature**: The speaker uses the simple request "make dua for me bro" to imply that this usually brief exchange unexpectedly became an extensive conversation. It suggests that the initial simplicity belied a more complex or engaging interaction that wasn't anticipated.

- **Presuppositions**: It's presumed that asking someone to make dua is typically a brief request, often not leading to prolonged discussions.

- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker, likely sharing a personal encounter, appears to intend humor or mild frustration. They address an audience familiar with the cultural context of "dua" to draw empathy and laughter.

- **Polarity**: The last sentence carries a neutral to slightly negative tone, evoking a sense of mild amusement or exasperation.

- **Pretense**: There is no substantial pretense in the speaker's attitude. The statement is direct and seems to reflect genuine surprise.

- **Meaning**: The literal meaning is just a description of a request for prayer leading to a long talk. The implied meaning adds an element of humor, noting the unpredictability of such interactions.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement shows a clear element of humor rooted in the unexpected spiraling of what was supposed to be a simple exchange. Therefore, the statement is sarcastic in its lighthearted depiction of the situation.

The tweet claims that a Congressional report on torture confirms that Al-Qaeda was not involved in the attacks of September 11.

- The speaker implies that there is a significant revelation or clarification regarding the 9/11 attacks, challenging the widely held belief about Al-Qaeda's involvement.
- The speaker appears to be implying that the public should reconsider the narrative surrounding 9/11 and possibly questions the validity of the government's previous stance on the attacks.
- What the speaker implies and thinks seems to be consistent. They are suggesting that this new piece of information changes the established understanding of the events, and they seem to be questioning or skeptical of prior reports.

The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; they appear to genuinely believe in the importance of this information and wish to share it with others.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the speaker is sharing an important piece of information, implying that a Congressional report challenges the established narrative that Al-Qaeda was involved in the 9/11 attacks. The speaker seems to be urging the public to reconsider the government's past stance and possibly question its validity. There is no indication of pretense in the speaker's attitude; they appear to sincerely believe in the significance of this information.

Based on the analysis:
- The implicature is that the official narrative of Al-Qaeda's involvement in 9/11 is being questioned.
- The presupposition is that the Congressional report is credible and contains significant revelations.
- The intent of the speaker appears to be to inform and provoke critical thinking or reconsideration of established beliefs about 9/11.

"We were miles apart, but you found me, now we are close enough, still apart #irony"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that despite the physical or emotional closeness that seems to have developed, there remains a significant emotional or relational distance between them. The reference to "now we are close enough, still apart" suggests that physical proximity or an attempt at connection hasn't resolved the underlying issue of feeling apart.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to find the situation frustrating or disappointing, as indicated by the use of the word "irony." They possibly hoped that being "close enough" would bridge the gap that "miles apart" represented, but the persistent sense of being "still apart" indicates that the connection they sought hasn't materialized as expected.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks align in expressing a sentiment of unfulfilled connection. They both highlight the discrepancy between the anticipated closeness and the reality of still feeling apart despite being nearer in a physical or metaphorical sense.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker may not necessarily be pretending to have a specific attitude, but they are likely conveying a genuine sense of disillusionment or melancholy. The use of "irony" hints at a resigned acknowledgment of the situation, rather than any pretense of contentment or satisfaction.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

The statement reflects a sentiment of disillusionment where the speaker describes a situation where physical proximity or an attempt to connect has not resolved the emotional or relational distance. The "irony" hashtag suggests that there's an expectation-reality mismatch. The speaker implies that despite being "close enough," the anticipated connection has not been realized, leaving them "still apart."

**Analysis:**

- **Implicature:** The speaker suggests that despite efforts to bridge the gap, the perceived closeness hasn't led to emotional unity.
  
- **Presuppositions:** It is assumed there was hope that being closer would resolve the feeling of being apart.

- **Intent:** The speaker appears to express frustration or disappointment with the situation, highlighting a disconnect between expectations and reality.

- **Polarity:** The overall tone is negative due to the expression of unfulfilled expectations.

- **Pretense:** There does not appear to be pretense; the speaker's attitude seems genuine in expressing disappointment.

- **Meaning:** The literal meaning discusses physical distance now reduced, while the implied meaning shows emotional distance still present despite this reduction.

Reflecting on this analysis, the statement indeed has a sarcastic tone driven by the use of "irony," highlighting the gap between expectation and reality in the relationship. Therefore, the statement is sarcastic.

The speaker mentions Zuma reading a quote, "People are not fighting for ideas, they fight for material benefits. To live in peace." #Irony #YCLNationalCongress.

- The speaker implies that there is irony in the quote read by Zuma, possibly because it contrasts an idealistic notion of fighting for ideas with a more pragmatic view of fighting for material benefits.
- The speaker might think that there is a disconnection between professed ideals and real motivations in social or political movements, especially in the context of a Congress like the YCL National Congress.
- What the speaker implies with the use of #Irony and what they think appears to be aligned; they both highlight a perceived incongruity or contradiction.

The speaker's use of the hashtag #Irony suggests that they might be adopting a slightly cynical or critical attitude toward the conversation, emphasizing the inconsistency between the noble pursuit of ideas and the underlying motivations of material gain. This hints that they indeed are assuming a critical stance toward the discourse.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature:** The statement implies a contrast between idealistic motives (fighting for ideas) and practical, self-serving motives (fighting for material benefits), suggesting a sense of hypocrisy.

**Presuppositions:** The statement presupposes that people often hide their true motivations behind noble-sounding ideas and that this is a familiar or common pattern, especially in political contexts like the YCL National Congress.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker aims to critique or highlight the inconsistency between proclaimed ideals and actual motivations, possibly targeting political figures like Zuma. By bringing attention to this irony, they might be questioning the authenticity of political discourse.

**Polarity:** The last sentence, marked by the hashtag #Irony, carries a negative tone by implying criticism or skepticism.

**Pretense:** The speaker's use of #Irony and a reference to Zuma suggests they are adopting a subtly mocking tone, indicating pretense in acknowledging the quote while highlighting its contradictions.

**Meaning:** The literal meaning is a simple statement of what people fight for, but the implied meaning critiques the disparity between professed ideals and true motivations, suggesting skepticism about the sincerity of political rhetoric.

**Reflection:** The preliminary analysis correctly identifies the speaker's critical stance and the implied irony. However, it could delve deeper into the context around Zuma, particularly any historical or cultural context tied to him that might amplify the perceived irony.

The statement is sarcastic, as it criticizes the inconsistency between noble claims of fighting for ideas and the reality of materialistic motives, using irony as a tool to question authenticity in political dialogue.

"I'm heading off, but need to say this! 'Just because I am concerned for my country, and it's people-Does #NOT make me a racist! #Terrorists'"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a current notion or accusation that being concerned about one's own country and its safety might be equated with racism. They seem to be addressing a topic surrounding national security and possibly immigration, suggesting that their concerns are wrongly being labeled as racist.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that it is possible to be concerned for the security and well-being of their country and its citizens without harboring any racist intentions. They are defensive about this perception and want to make it clear that their motivations are not rooted in racism.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's direct assertion convey the idea that they believe concerns for national security should not automatically be interpreted as racism. They feel misunderstood or unfairly judged based on their stance.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; rather, they appear to be genuinely frustrated and defensive about what they perceive as an unjust accusation or generalization about their views. The language used indicates sincerity in wanting to clarify their position.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis assesses the statement that expresses frustration about being labeled as a racist due to concerns for national security. The speaker implies a public perception that links concern for one's country with racism, and they address this by asserting one can hold such concerns without being racist. 

1. **Implicature**: There is an implied accusation the speaker is defending against, likely from others equating their concerns with racism.
   
2. **Presuppositions**: The speaker presupposes that accusations of racism exist in contexts of national security discussions, possibly tied to issues like immigration.

3. **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker is attempting to clear their name from association with racism while maintaining their stance on national security, addressing a broad audience who may be part of the accusers.

4. **Polarity**: The tone is defensive, which carries a negative undertone due to the frustration and need to justify their position.

5. **Pretense**: There is no pretense indicated; the speaker appears sincere in their frustration over being misunderstood.

6. **Literal vs. Implied Meaning**: Literally, the speaker denies being racist. Implicitly, they argue against being unfairly judged for their concerns about safety and security, suggesting they find such judgments baseless.

Reflecting on the analysis, it remains consistent with analyzing the speaker's frustration and defensiveness against perceived unjust accusations. The statement lacks the irony or exaggerated contradictions typical of sarcasm. Therefore, based on this analysis, the statement is not sarcastic.

The speaker's statement is: "Everybody's Talking about Snow and I'm just Sitting Here and the only Snow around is on our Cars.. #snow #not"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a lot of buzz or conversation about snow elsewhere (possibly on social media or in the news), but where they are, the only snow they see is limited to what's on their cars, suggesting that the snowfall isn't as substantial or significant as the discussions might indicate.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker perhaps feels somewhat detached or excluded from the excitement or concern that others are experiencing regarding snow since their personal experience doesn't match the broader narrative. There may be a hint of sarcasm in the use of "#snow #not," suggesting they are downplaying the situation where they are.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, they are aligned. The speaker's implication that snow is present only minimally on their cars reflects their thought process of not truly experiencing the snow event being widely discussed, potentially with a sense of irony or humor.

The speaker is likely pretending to have a tone of indifference or humor toward the conversation. By using a somewhat sarcastic hashtag, they imply that the situation doesn't align with the broader hype or concern about snow, suggesting lighthearted disengagement from the prevailing discourse.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Preliminary Analysis Summary:**

- **Implicature:** There's an underlying suggestion that despite widespread discussion or excitement about snow, the speaker's encounter with it is quite limited, only seeing it on cars.
- **Presuppositions:** The conversation takes for granted that there's a significant amount of discourse about snow elsewhere that the speaker is exposed to.
- **Intent:** The speaker aims to convey a sense of irony or humor, possibly pointing out the mismatch between what others are experiencing or discussing and their own reality. The speaker seems to address a general audience on social media.
- **Polarity:** The tone of the last part, especially with the "#not," suggests a negative or dismissive tone towards the idea of significant snowfall.
- **Pretense:** The speaker exhibits a pretense of indifference or humor, using sarcasm to downplay the seriousness or excitement others may have about snow.
- **Meaning:** Literally, the statement mentions snow being on cars, but implied is a mocking of the hype about snow that turns out to be unimpressive in their location.

**Reflection and Decision:**

Upon reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it can be confirmed that the statement employs sarcasm. The use of "#snow #not" highlights the disparity between expected or discussed conditions and the speaker's actual minimal exposure to snow. The speaker uses sarcasm to humorously acknowledge they are not experiencing the snow event to the degree that is being spoken about, showing a disconnection from the prevailing discourse.

The tweet says, "@RosieMorse I hate you lol."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies a sense of playfulness or joking demeanor by adding "lol" at the end of their statement. This could suggest that the statement isn't meant to be taken entirely seriously.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker might actually have some level of annoyance or negative feeling towards RosieMorse, but it doesn't seem deeply serious given the use of "lol," indicating they may be trying to keep the tone light-hearted.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Not exactly. The use of "lol" implies a joking manner, but the words "I hate you" suggest a negative sentiment. This implies a discrepancy between what is said at face value and the potential underlying message or feelings.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, it seems the speaker is pretending to have a more light-hearted or humorous attitude as indicated by "lol," even if there might be some genuine frustration or annoyance behind the words.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis suggests that the statement "@RosieMorse I hate you lol" contains both literal and implied meanings that differ. The literal part, "I hate you," suggests negativity, but ending it with "lol" implies a lack of seriousness, inferring a joking or playful tone. The speaker may be experiencing a degree of annoyance or frustration towards RosieMorse, yet uses "lol" to soften the statement and portray a more humorous intent. Therefore, there is a pretense in the speaker's attitude as they project a light-hearted demeanor despite potentially experiencing some genuine negative emotions.

Reflecting on this, the conclusion is that the statement is sarcastic. The speaker uses sarcasm to express a negative sentiment in a way that softens the blow, with the added "lol" signaling that the statement is not to be taken at face value.

"So Jeremy Irons and Alan Rickman are BOTH in Marrakech just one week before I'm going there #everythingisfine #not #sonot"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are disappointed or frustrated because they will miss the opportunity to see Jeremy Irons and Alan Rickman in Marrakech as their visit does not coincide with the speaker's trip. 

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that the situation is not fine, contrary to the initial part of the hashtag. They are likely unhappy or annoyed that they will miss seeing these celebrities while they are in Marrakech.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts convey disappointment and dissatisfaction with the timing of the celebrities' visit and their own schedule.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm, as indicated by the hashtags #everythingisfine and #not #sonot, to express their true attitude of annoyance or discontent about missing the chance to be in Marrakech at the same time as the celebrities. They are not genuinely expressing contentment or indifference about the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement implies disappointment and frustration about not being in Marrakech at the same time as Jeremy Irons and Alan Rickman. The speaker is sarcastic, as shown by the hashtags #everythingisfine, #not, and #sonot, misleading from the seemingly positive initial phrase to a negative sentiment. The pretense lies in the initial suggestion that everything is fine, while the intended meaning is the opposite. The speaker hopes to convey annoyance or dissatisfaction with missing the timing of these celebrities' visit. The polarity is negative due to this implied tone of disappointment. Thus, the initial analysis correctly identifies the use of sarcasm in the speaker's expression. The literal and implied meanings differ, where the literal suggests contentment, while the implied meaning is dissatisfaction. The analysis doesn't require significant changes as it accurately captures the sarcasm in the statement.

The statement is: "@bwinter Shirota Yu and... Inoue Yoshio? He was in Mozart! apparently."

- The speaker implies a certain level of uncertainty or surprise about Inoue Yoshio's involvement in "Mozart!". The use of "apparently" suggests that this is new information to the speaker, or they may not be entirely confident about it.
- The speaker seems to think that this information about Inoue Yoshio is intriguing or worth noting, as they are sharing it in a tweet. However, there's a hint that they are not deeply familiar with Inoue Yoshio or his work, indicated by the pause and question mark.
- What the speaker implies and what they think do appear to be aligned. They imply that the information is noteworthy yet possibly incomplete and think it adds value to the conversation they are having, likely sharing it to inform or engage with @bwinter.
- It does not appear that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude. Their tone comes across as genuine and inquisitive rather than feigned.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement expresses surprise or uncertainty about the involvement of Inoue Yoshio in "Mozart!", using a questioning tone and the word "apparently" to signal this sentiment. The speaker shares this information to engage with the person tagged, @bwinter, suggesting they find it interesting or novel. The conversation presumes some level of familiarity with Shirota Yu and Inoue Yoshio, but not detailed knowledge of Yoshio's career. The speaker's tone is curious and genuine, lacking pretense, and there is no significant mismatch between the literal and implied meanings. 

The preliminary analysis correctly identifies the inquisitive and genuine tone of the statement. The implication is clear; the speaker has learned something new and is sharing it, which aligns with their goal to engage socially and share this tidbit. Given these factors, the statement is not sarcastic. The tone is neither overly positive nor negative, just neutral and curious. The analysis does not require adjustments, as all aspects have been accurately addressed.

"Cause I love going to bed alone every night.. #not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Cause I love going to bed alone every night.. #not" is analyzed as being sarcastic. The speaker implies dissatisfaction with going to bed alone, contradicting the literal statement. The hashtag "#not" directly signals sarcasm, revealing the true negative sentiment towards the situation. The speaker's intent is to express displeasure or loneliness. There is a clear pretense, as they state they "love" the situation, but actually, they do not. The polarity is negative due to the undertone of loneliness and dissatisfaction, and the meaning is opposite to what is literally stated.

The preliminary analysis is correct. There were no points from the preliminary analysis that need changing. The statement is sarcastic, as the speaker does not genuinely enjoy going to bed alone.

"Stupid #doctors visits is gonna bury me!! Now that's #irony"

- What the speaker implies about the situation: The speaker is implying that the cost or frequency of doctor visits is overwhelming and may lead to financial or emotional ruin, and they find it ironically frustrating given the purpose of such visits is to prevent harm, not cause it.
- What the speaker thinks about the situation: The speaker is expressing frustration and a sense of irony about the situation, possibly highlighting the unexpected burden or contradiction in seeking healthcare.
- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing? Yes, both imply a feeling of frustration and irony regarding the burden caused by doctor's visits, which are intended to be beneficial.

The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude; their expression of frustration and irony appears genuine.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Based on the analysis, the statement implies that the speaker finds it paradoxical and frustrating that doctor's visits, which are meant to improve health and prevent harm, are actually causing distress or harm, particularly in terms of financial burden. The presupposition here is that doctor visits should ideally be beneficial rather than financially straining.

The speaker's intent appears to be an expression of frustration and perhaps a critique of the healthcare system, highlighting the irony that something meant to improve wellbeing is causing stress. The speaker uses hashtags like #irony to underscore this contradictory situation.

The polarity of the sentence is negative, given the use of words like "stupid" and "bury me." There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude, as the frustration appears to be genuine.

The literal meaning—that doctor's visits will lead to being "buried"—is significantly more dramatic than the implied meaning, which suggests a level of overwhelming distress or financial burden caused by these visits.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement seems genuine in its expression of frustration and irony, rather than sarcastic. The use of irony here is explicit, rather than sarcastic, as the speaker directly points out the contradiction. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

The statement is: "From what I can tell...most strippers belong right where they are #nocollegeneeded #adamsmith #specialization #strippers"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement? 
  The speaker implies that being a stripper is an appropriate or natural place for most strippers to be. The use of hashtags suggests that the speaker believes strippers do not need a college education, implying that they are well-suited or even specialized for this line of work without further academic qualifications.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to have a dismissive or possibly degrading view of strippers, suggesting that they need not or should not aspire to roles that require a college education. This may reflect a perception that people in this profession do not possess or need the skills associated with attending college.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the explicit thought suggest that strippers are suited to stay within their current occupation, without needing academic advancement. The use of the phrase "belong right where they are" further reinforces a sense of stasis or appropriateness for the role.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
It doesn't appear that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude; the statement seems direct and unfiltered, reflecting a genuine belief. However, the speaker may be using a sarcastic or cynical tone that could be mistaken for humor or judgment, depending on the context and the speaker's intentions.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Implicature:
The statement implies that strippers are where they naturally fit and that their job does not require the resources or skills obtained from college education. The hashtags suggest that their profession is an example of specialization, to which Adam Smith's economic principles may apply.

Presuppositions:
It is taken for granted that strippers do not need higher education and that their roles are adequately met without it. This presupposes that academic qualifications are necessary only for roles outside of stripping.

Intent of the Speaker:
The speaker seems to aim to make a point about the perceived suitability of strippers for their roles and possibly about the division of labor in society. The speaker is potentially critiquing societal norms or expectations about work and education.

Polarity:
The tone of the last sentence, despite seeming neutral, carries a dismissive or negative tone towards the profession of stripping by implying it does not need further aspiration or academic improvement.

Pretense:
There may be a pretense of superiority or judgment in the speaker's attitude, as they appear to make an evaluative claim about strippers and their role in society. The use of hashtags could be ironic, suggesting a sarcastic undertone.

Meaning:
The literal meaning states strippers fit their current role well, suggesting no need for further education. Implied is a potentially degrading or limiting viewpoint that dismisses their aspirations or abilities.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement seems sarcastic. The use of hashtags and the phrase "belong right where they are" may be intended to mock societal opinions on education's value, or belittle the profession by suggesting it as inferior to others that require college degrees.

The statement is: "Our 3 losses followed bye weeks & an FCS team. Do we get rid of those next year? #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a pattern or correlation in their team’s losses following bye weeks and games against an FCS team, suggesting that removing these situations could potentially lead to not losing.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that attributing losses purely to the scheduling (bye weeks and FCS games) is not a reasonable solution. The use of sarcasm implies they find such a suggestion to be unrealistic or overly simplistic. 

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the underlying thought convey that merely adjusting the schedule by avoiding bye weeks or FCS opponents will not inherently solve the issue of losing games, highlighting the illogical nature of such a solution.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker uses sarcasm, which suggests they are pretending to seriously consider the idea of avoiding bye weeks and FCS teams as a legitimate solution, when in fact they believe it's not. This sarcastic tone reveals their skepticism or disbelief in the validity of the implied solution.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Summary of the Preliminary Analysis:

The speaker implies that simply removing bye weeks and FCS games would prevent further losses, highlighting a pattern in past losses which occurred following such events. The statement shows skepticism toward this idea, hinting at its oversimplification and impracticality. This is underscored by the use of sarcasm, indicating the speaker's disbelief in the suggested solution being effective. Both the implication and what the speaker thinks align, as they question the irrationality of relying solely on scheduling adjustments to prevent future losses. The speaker pretends to entertain the notion humorously, using sarcasm to emphasize their point. The tone of the statement is negative, as it critiques the simplistic approach to solving the problem.

Decision:
The statement is sarcastic. The intended pretense is to mock the idea that avoiding bye weeks and FCS teams would be a viable strategy for success, using sarcasm to illustrate its absurdity.

"Literally functioning on 4 hours of sleep and I feel great 😄 !! #Not #CollegeisKillingMe #OneMoreWeek"

- The speaker implies that they are actually not feeling great at all despite having only 4 hours of sleep. The use of #Not sarcastically suggests that their initial claim is not true. They also imply that college is taking a toll on their well-being, possibly causing them stress and lack of sleep.
  
- The speaker likely thinks the situation is difficult and exasperating. They might be feeling overwhelmed by college responsibilities, leading to sleep deprivation.

- What the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are the same: they are not feeling great due to lack of sleep likely caused by college pressures. The use of sarcasm highlights their frustration.

- The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their use of sarcasm and hashtags shows genuine frustration and exhaustion regarding their current situation in college.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis focuses on the speaker's use of sarcasm to express their frustration with the challenges of college life, particularly the exhaustion from lack of sleep. The statement's literal meaning is contradicted by the implied meaning, which is that the speaker does not feel great despite claiming otherwise. Everything taken for granted hints at a shared understanding among college students about the stress and sleep deprivation they face. 

The tone in the last sentence is negative, and the speaker's intent is to express their fatigue and frustration humorously. The use of the hashtag "#Not" underlines the sarcasm by overtly contradicting the positive claim of feeling great. There's no pretense in the speaker's attitude; their sarcasm reveals genuine emotions regarding their stress and exhaustion.

Reflecting on this analysis, it is clear that the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker uses sarcasm to critique their college experience and share their true feelings with others who might relate.

The speaker's statement is: "Somebody has filled my head with snot & used a cheese grater on the back of my throat during the night #unimpressed".

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they are feeling very unwell, likely suffering from symptoms of a cold or flu, such as nasal congestion and a sore throat. The exaggerated imagery of having their head filled with snot and using a cheese grater on their throat conveys the severity of their discomfort.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker is clearly unhappy and likely frustrated with their current state, as indicated by the hashtag #unimpressed. They seem to feel that they are being inconvenienced by these unpleasant symptoms.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both imply and indicate that the speaker is feeling sick and is displeased with the situation. The dramatic and humorous way of expressing their symptoms highlights their dissatisfaction.

Finally, the speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; their exaggerated language is a humorous way to express genuine discomfort and displeasure with their current state.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement employs hyperbolic and humorous imagery to convey their intense discomfort due to likely cold or flu symptoms. By using phrases like "filled my head with snot" and "used a cheese grater on the back of my throat," they communicate the severity of their condition in a vivid but exaggerated manner. The hashtag #unimpressed indicates their unhappiness and frustration with feeling unwell. While the speaker's literal words describe a bizarre scenario, the implied meaning focuses on feeling very sick and uncomfortable. There's no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are genuinely expressing dissatisfaction through humor.

The analysis is correct in identifying the humorous exaggeration used to express displeasure. The dramatic language underlines the speaker's negative experience but does not suggest that they are genuinely amused or indifferent to their condition. The tone of the statement is negative. Given these points, the statement is not sarcastic but rather a humorous exaggeration meant to highlight genuine discomfort. Sarcasm generally involves irony where the literal meaning contradicts the speaker's true feelings; in this case, the hyperbolic description aligns with the speaker's apparent discontent.

"If only I could be a cooler kid xp lol I'm such a nerd #can #i #know #when #im #not #gonna #get #rejected"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?  
  The speaker implies that they feel like they don't fit the "cool kid" stereotype and are possibly experiencing feelings of inadequacy or rejection. They wish they could be accepted or fit in more with what is perceived as cool.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?  
  The speaker thinks they are a "nerd" and are likely self-conscious about it. They use humor (“xp” and “lol”) to possibly downplay their feelings of inadequacy or to cope with these emotions. The hashtags suggest a concern with social rejection.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?  
  Yes, the speaker implies they are not part of the "cool crowd" and thinks of themselves as a "nerd," suggesting feelings of isolation or rejection; both the implication and thought express the same underlying feeling of not fitting in or meeting societal standards of coolness.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.  
The speaker may be pretending to take the situation lightly by using “lol” and sarcastic hashtags, which can suggest an attempt to mask their true feelings of inadequacy or rejection.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Summary of the preliminary analysis:

The speaker feels like they don't belong to the "cool kid" group and experiences feelings of inadequacy or rejection. They view themselves as a "nerd" and might be self-conscious about it. Humor ('xp' and 'lol') is used to downplay their emotions or to cope. The hashtags indicate a concern with social rejection. The implication and their thoughts are aligned in expressing feelings of not fitting in. The speaker might be pretending to take the situation lightly through the use of sarcastic hashtags and laughter, suggesting an attempt to mask their true emotions.

Implicature: The speaker implies dissatisfaction with not fitting in with the "cool" stereotype and perhaps anticipates rejection.

Presuppositions: It is assumed that there is a "cool" standard they don't meet and that being a "nerd" is less desirable. 

Intent: The speaker seems to seek empathy or understanding from others by downplaying their feelings with humor while expressing underlying insecurity.

Polarity: The tone has a negative undertone due to feelings of inadequacy, despite the humorous phrasing.

Pretense: Yes, the speaker uses humor and sarcasm to mask their true feelings.

Meaning: The literal meaning is a wish to be cooler, while the implied meaning reflects a deeper sense of isolation and self-deprecation masked with humor.

Reflection: The analysis aligns with the undertones of sarcasm. The use of humor masks genuine feelings of inadequacy. Therefore, the statement is sarcastic.

- **Polarity:** The tone is negative, focusing on criticism and perceived hypocrisy.
- **Pretense:** No pretense; the speaker seems genuinely critical and amused by the situation.
- **Meaning:** The literal statement outlines specific criticisms, while the implied meaning mocks the perceived hypocrisy and lack of self-awareness.

The use of "#not" implies that the update is not genuine, relevant, or significant. The analysis also concludes that the speaker is not pretending to have their dismissive attitude, as they genuinely seem to question the validity or importance of the update.

In analyzing the statement:

- The implicature suggests disbelief or skepticism about the update being significant or true.
- The presupposition is that there's an expected update or information about "clash," which is taken for granted to be likely misleading or false by the speaker.
- The speaker's intent appears to be to convey that the linked update is unreliable or not noteworthy.
- The polarity is negative due to the dismissive nature of "#not."

"work Wednesday-Sunday .. #yay #not #moneytho 😩😭💰😒"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are not thrilled about working from Wednesday to Sunday. The use of hashtags like "#yay #not", and emojis such as 😩 and 😒, suggests a lack of enthusiasm. However, the mention of "#moneytho 💰" implies that the speaker acknowledges the financial benefit or necessity of working these days.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely feels obligated or resigned to working these days despite not wanting to, as indicated by the conflicting emotions in the hashtags and emojis. They appreciate the monetary gain this schedule provides, but are not happy about the schedule itself.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think reflect a sentiment of dissatisfaction with their work schedule tempered by an understanding of its financial necessity. The speaker is conveying a sentiment of mixed feelings—reluctance due to the working days but recognition of needing or wanting the money.

-Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker seems to genuinely express a conflicted feeling towards the situation, rather than pretending to have a specific attitude. They are open about their dissatisfaction and the necessity for money, without hiding either sentiment.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**The Implicature**: The speaker implies dissatisfaction with working from Wednesday to Sunday but acknowledges the necessity of earning money. The use of hashtags "#yay" and "#not" highlight the contrast between the perceived positivity of having a job and the negative feelings towards the work schedule.

**The Presuppositions**: It is assumed that having money is important or necessary to the speaker, which justifies their decision to work these days despite not liking it.

**The Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker intends to express frustration with their work schedule while acknowledging its financial benefits. They likely aim to share their predicament in a relatable manner that could resonate with others in similar situations.

**The Polarity**: The overall tone is negative due to dissatisfaction with the work schedule, but there is a slight positive acknowledgment of earning money.

**Pretense**: There is no apparent pretense. The speaker openly shares mixed feelings, indicating authenticity in their expression.

**Meaning**: Literally, the statement indicates the speaker works from Wednesday to Sunday. Implied, it conveys dissatisfaction with this schedule but acceptance due to financial necessity.

**Reflection:** The preliminary analysis effectively captures the speaker's conflicted emotions towards their work schedule. The use of "#yay #not" signals sarcasm, highlighting the speaker's true discontent masked by a facetious "yay." The statement is sarcastic because the speaker's expression of enthusiasm ("#yay") contradicts their actual feelings ("#not").

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears to be critical of military strategies that involve drone strikes, especially when they result in civilian casualties like the death of children. The use of sarcasm ("seems to b working so well") and the hashtag "#not" indicates a strong disapproval of the method and its continued use.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts are aligned in expressing criticism and disapproval of drone strikes and their effectiveness, especially due to the unintended consequences of civilian casualties.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is likely not pretending; the use of sarcasm and the hashtag "#not" indicate genuine sarcasm and criticism rather than a pretense of approval or support.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature:** The speaker implies that using drone strikes that result in the death of children is an ineffective and morally questionable military strategy.

**Presuppositions:** The speaker takes for granted that drone strikes are currently being used and that they result in civilian casualties, specifically children. Additionally, the speaker presupposes that these strategies are meant to be effective and ethical but are failing on both fronts.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker aims to critique and express displeasure with the use of drone strikes in military operations, highlighting the tragic consequences such as the death of children. The speaker is likely anti-military or anti-war, addressing those who may support or justify the use of drone strikes.

**Polarity:** The tone of the statement is negative. It expresses criticism and disapproval of the current strategy.

**Pretense:** There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude. The speaker uses sarcasm to convey genuine criticism and disapproval.

**Meaning:** Literally, the statement suggests that killing kids in a drone strike is a strategy that works, but the implied meaning, strengthened by the sarcasm and hashtag "#not," indicates that the speaker strongly believes the opposite.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it aligns well with these observations. The statement is indeed sarcastic, as it uses irony to critique the strategy sarcastically by contrasting the literal meaning with the implied criticism of its ineffectiveness and moral consequences.

The statement is: "I know who I am. I am not perfect. I'm not the most beautiful woman in the world. But I'm one of them. #women #not #perfet|-Mary J. Blige"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that self-awareness and self-acceptance are important. She acknowledges her imperfections but asserts her value and beauty, indicating confidence and a positive self-image.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature**: Beyond the literal meaning, the speaker implies that while nobody is perfect, it's possible to still recognize one's beauty and self-worth.

**Presuppositions**: The statement presupposes that perfection isn’t necessary to be considered beautiful. It also takes for granted that beauty is subjective and inclusive.

**Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker, Mary J. Blige, aims to promote a message of self-acceptance, confidence, and empowerment among women. The use of hashtags suggests she is addressing women broadly and contributing to a larger conversation about beauty and self-worth.

**Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence is positive, as it asserts self-worth and beauty.

**Pretense**: There is no pretense; the speaker’s attitude appears to be sincere. 

**Meaning**: The literal meaning aligns with the implied meaning — Mary J. Blige is acknowledging her imperfections while affirming her beauty. She projects self-awareness and confidence.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is genuine and not sarcastic. The speaker clearly conveys a message of self-empowerment and acceptance, without any hidden mocking or opposing sentiment. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

"Welll helllo fever. Id say 103 is feelin real good today #not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they have a fever with a temperature of 103 degrees, which is quite high and generally indicates someone is unwell. The use of "feelin real good" in a sarcastic manner suggests that the fever is not actually making them feel good at all.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is clearly not happy about the situation. The high fever is likely causing them discomfort or distress, and they are expressing this through sarcasm.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they explicitly say are aligned. They are pretending to say they feel good, but the hashtag “#not” and the context show that they are indeed feeling miserable.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is using sarcasm to convey their true feelings about the situation. Their real attitude is one of displeasure and discomfort, despite the sarcastic expression of feeling "real good."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis indicates that the speaker is using sarcasm to highlight their discomfort from having a high fever, specifically a temperature of 103 degrees. The implicature is that the speaker feels unwell, as fever temperatures this high are concerning, but they state it in a manner that superficially contradicts this. The presupposition is that the listener understands that having a fever of 103 is not a desirable or comfortable state. The intent is to express discontent and perhaps elicit sympathy from those who read the statement. The polarity of the statement, despite the surface-level positive language ("feelin real good"), is negative, as indicated by the sarcastic tone and the hashtag "#not." The pretense in the statement lies in the speaker's adopting an exaggeratedly cheerful tone to underscore how far from good they actually feel.

Reflecting on the analysis, it's clear the statement uses sarcasm. The literal meaning suggests feeling good with a high fever, which is absurd. The hashtag "#not" helps clarify this disconnect, confirming the sarcastic intent. Hence, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

"Almost 72 hs of a kid asking for his Christmas gift and zero answers from @AskPlayStation thank you guys! you are awesome #not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that @AskPlayStation has been unresponsive and unhelpful, leading to frustration over a kid not receiving a Christmas gift that is possibly related to a PlayStation product or service.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is clearly frustrated and disappointed with @AskPlayStation's lack of response and assistance.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think indicate their dissatisfaction with @AskPlayStation's service.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm ("thank you guys! you are awesome #not") to express their frustration, showing that they are not genuinely thanking them or consider their service awesome. This suggests the speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; they are openly expressing displeasure.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker implies that @AskPlayStation has been unresponsive for almost 72 hours, leading to frustration as a kid's Christmas gift remains pending. The speaker is using sarcasm here, particularly with the phrase "thank you guys! you are awesome #not," which indicates their irritation rather than genuine gratitude or admiration. The polarity of the statement is negative, given the dissatisfaction expressed. There is pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they are using sarcasm to express their genuine disappointment with the service. The literal meaning of thanking @AskPlayStation contrasts with the implied criticism, reinforcing the sarcasm.

Reviewing the preliminary analysis, it correctly identifies the sarcasm in the speaker's statement and aligns it with the speaker's intent to communicate their frustration openly. The statement is indeed sarcastic.

**Implicature:** The speaker implies that they are nearing an important milestone in their pregnancy, and the results of the 30-week prenatal scan are positive. Anticipation and excitement are conveyed through the expectation of meeting their baby boy soon.

**Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that the speaker is undergoing a routine prenatal check-up and everything is proceeding normally, as suggested by the positive hashtags and tone.

**Intent of the speaker:** The speaker likely aims to share their excitement and joy about the progress of their pregnancy with their audience, possibly friends or family who follow them on Twitter.

**Polarity:** The tone of the statement is positive, as evidenced by the use of cheerful and optimistic hashtags like "#exciting," "#happy," and "#clear."

**Pretense:** There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude. The emotional tone and wording reflect a genuine sense of happiness and anticipation.

The implied meaning reinforces this positivity by emphasizing the nearing arrival of their baby boy and the healthy progress of the pregnancy.

Based on this analysis, the preliminary analysis doesn't need changes as it correctly identifies the speaker's genuine positive sentiment. The statement is not sarcastic; it is an earnest expression of excitement and happiness about the nearing birth of their healthy baby boy.

The statement is: "A 'republican move' which will 'effectively rob the royals'. Kate's spending 32k on 1 meal, who is being robbed? #irony http://t.co/OTbeWggbTJ"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is a perceived contradiction or irony in describing a move as 'republican' and potentially harmful to the royals, while simultaneously pointing out an extravagant expense by Kate, a member of the royal family. The term 'republican move' suggests actions aimed at reducing the power or privileges of the monarchy, and the hashtag #irony suggests that the speaker finds it ironic that expensive spending is associated with royalty when they're supposedly being 'robbed'.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to be skeptical or critical of the notion that the royals are being 'robbed'. By highlighting the amount spent by Kate on a meal, the speaker likely feels that the idea of the royals being victimized is exaggerated or misplaced.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both what is implied and what is stated indicate that the speaker finds it inconsistent to frame the royals as victims of loss or theft, given the lavish spending habits outlined within the tweet.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
  The speaker does not appear to be pretending to hold a particular attitude. Their use of the word 'irony' and the critical tone suggests a genuine skepticism or disbelief towards the narrative that the royal family is being financially 'robbed'.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis explains that the speaker of the tweet uses irony to highlight a perceived contradiction in a 'republican move' supposedly set to 'rob the royals', juxtaposed against Kate's expensive meal costing 32k. The speaker implies that the narrative of royals being 'robbed' is ironic or inconsistent considering their lavish expenditures. The skeptic tone displayed by emphasizing Kate's extravagant spending and the use of the hashtag #irony suggests genuine criticism of the situation rather than a facade. Both the implications and speaker's thoughts align in suggesting disbelief towards the idea of the royals as victims. 

The polarity of the tweet's last sentence carries a negative tone as it questions the notion of who is being truly 'robbed'. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are expressing a straightforward skepticism towards the narrative. The literal meaning points to royal victimization in a ‘republican move’, while the implied meaning highlights the irony in lavish expenditure of royals themselves. 

Overall, given the sarcastic use of 'irony' and the questioning nature of the statement about who is really being robbed, the statement can be classified as sarcastic. The preliminary analysis holds well, and the statement indeed employs sarcasm to critique the perceived narrative.

The speaker's tweet is: "effigies of jesus or allah..... when she herself hadnt kept any of d hindu gods #irony"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is a contradiction or inconsistency in the actions of "she," who has kept effigies of Jesus or Allah but has not kept any effigies of the Hindu gods, despite possibly being expected to do so due to her background or context. The hashtag "#irony" signals that the speaker finds this paradoxical.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to think that the situation is ironic, potentially unfair, or hypocritical, given it challenges common expectations or norms. This suggests that they perceive the situation as noteworthy and see some humor or critique in pointing out the inconsistency.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's explicit thought convey surprise or criticism of the perceived inconsistency in religious representation. The notion of "irony" bridges the implication of contradiction with the speaker's opinion.

Regarding whether the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation, it doesn’t seem like the speaker is pretending. The use of the hashtag and the specific mention of "irony" suggests genuine intrigue or criticism towards what they perceive as a contradiction.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The provided analysis focuses on the speaker's intention to highlight a perceived contradiction in the actions of "she," who has effigies of Jesus or Allah but has not kept any of the Hindu gods. The hashtag "#irony" hints that the speaker sees this as paradoxical. The speaker finds the situation noteworthy, possibly pointing out inconsistency with some humor or critique. The analysis concludes that the speaker's implied meaning and their explicit thoughts align, as both express surprise or criticism regarding the inconsistency. There doesn't appear to be any pretense in the speaker's attitude, suggesting genuine intrigue or criticism.

Upon reflection, the speaker's use of "#irony" and the mention of perceived inconsistency suggest an air of sarcasm. The speaker likely intends to critique or mock the situation by emphasizing the juxtaposition between religious practices and expectations. While the literal statement points out a factual observation, the implied meaning conveys a sarcastic tone towards the inconsistency observed. Thus, the statement should be considered sarcastic.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Because a field trip two days before finals is exactly what I need #not" is analyzed as sarcasm. The implicature suggests that having a field trip so close to finals is unnecessary and likely a bad idea. The presupposition is that students typically need to study or prepare for finals, making other activities inconvenient. The speaker, likely a student, is expressing frustration and criticism towards whoever scheduled the trip. Thus, their intent is to convey disapproval and highlight the inconvenience of this timing.

The polarity of the statement is negative, as it indicates dissatisfaction. The pretense in attitude is minimal, as the speaker's use of "#not" clearly signals the sarcasm and their genuine feelings. The literal meaning of the statement suggests that the speaker needs a field trip then, but the implied meaning, bolstered by the sarcastic hashtag, is the exact opposite. 

Reflecting on this analysis, the initial conclusion that the statement is sarcastic is correct. The literal and implied meanings differ, with the latter conveying the true negative sentiment of the speaker.

The literal meaning is simply both stating it wasn't all their fault, but the implied meaning offers humor in assumed shared experiences of unfair blame.

Upon reflection, the preliminary analysis might be accurate in recognizing this humor. The statement is not sarcastic, as it delivers this commentary through light-hearted humor rather than veiled criticism.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they have come down with a severe cold or flu (commonly referred to humorously as "man flu") right before they have to work through the weekend, and they are not pleased about this unfortunate timing.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is clearly frustrated and unhappy about having to deal with being sick while they have work responsibilities ahead, especially during a weekend, which is typically associated with rest or leisure activities.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the implication and the speaker's thoughts align. Both indicate that the speaker is upset about being sick during a time they need to work.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm, which suggests that they are pretending to be excited or positive with the use of "awesome" when they really mean the opposite. This is highlighted by the use of humor and sarcasm to emphasize their displeasure.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Full on man flu just in time for a weekend of work!! #awesome #sarcasm #coldandflu" carries several implied meanings:

- **Implicature**: The speaker is suggesting that having a 'man flu' (a humorous term for a severe cold or flu) coinciding with a weekend meant for work is frustrating and inconvenient.
- **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that the speaker has work to do over the weekend and that being ill is undesirable, especially at this time.
- **Intent of the speaker**: The speaker aims to express their frustration and disappointment over the unfortunate timing of their illness, possibly seeking sympathy or camaraderie from the audience by using humor.
- **Polarity**: The tone is negative, as indicated by the use of sarcasm with the word "awesome" being intended to mean the opposite.
- **Pretense**: There is pretense in expressing excitement through sarcasm, as the speaker doesn’t actually find the situation awesome.
- **Meaning**: The literal meaning of "awesome" suggests something positive, but the implied meaning, reinforced by the hashtag #sarcasm, is that the situation is quite the opposite of awesome.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it effectively captures the essence of sarcasm present in the speaker's statement. The speaker uses sarcasm to highlight their displeasure with both the illness and the timing, contradicting the literal positive connotation of "awesome." Therefore, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is implying, through the use of sarcasm, that they disapprove of the new legislation in Illinois making it illegal to record the police. Their choice of the word "great" is meant to convey the opposite sentiment, indicating that they view this development negatively.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies with their sarcastic remark is consistent with what they think: they are unhappy with this legislative decision and think it is a bad move.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is not genuinely expressing happiness or approval about the bill, and is using sarcasm to indicate their true negative attitude toward the situation. Therefore, they are not pretending to have a positive attitude; rather, they are making clear their disapproval through sarcasm.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

The speaker uses sarcasm to express disapproval of the new Illinois legislation that makes it illegal to record the police. The word "great" is used ironically, indicating a negative sentiment towards the bill. The statement implies a belief that this law undermines public rights to transparency and accountability in police actions, reflecting dissatisfaction and concern. The literal and implied meanings are at odds—the surface-level statement seems positive, but the underlying intent is negative. There is no genuine pretense of approval; the sarcasm highlights the speaker's true discontent with the situation.

**Analysis:**

1. **Implicature**: The speaker suggests that the legislation is harmful and undesirable, contrary to its literal depiction as "great."

2. **Presuppositions**: The speaker assumes that the audience is aware of the general expectation of transparency and holds a critical view of legislation that undermines this.

3. **Intent**: The speaker aims to critique the bill and highlight its negative implications for public accountability. The intended audience likely includes individuals concerned about civil liberties and government oversight.

4. **Polarity**: The tone of the last sentence, despite using the word "great," is negative due to the sarcasm indicated by the hashtag.

5. **Pretense**: There is little authentic pretense of a positive attitude; the speaker is evidently expressing a negative view through sarcasm.

6. **Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests something positive, but the implied meaning is a critique of the legislation.

**Conclusion**:

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, all aspects confirm that the statement is sarcastic. The analysis accurately identifies the use of sarcasm to oppose the legislation, so no changes are necessary to the preliminary evaluation. The statement is indeed sarcastic.

"We may be some time. #Hibernot #Not http://t.co/n5z2IXabq9"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they are going to be away or busy for a period of time. The use of "#Hibernot" could suggest that they're not actually going into "hibernation" or a long absence, contrasting the traditional idea of hibernation with their upcoming situation. The hashtag "#Not" might indicate the speaker is emphasizing a playful or sarcastic tone about not truly taking that time away.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to view the situation humorously or light-heartedly, using hashtags to punctuate their message. They might feel that although they are saying they will be gone for a while, it is not a serious or alarming absence. They are likely hinting at a temporary retreat or a short break rather than an extended disappearance.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts align. They both convey the idea of being away or out of touch for a bit, but in a way that is not meant to be taken too seriously, as suggested by the use of playful hashtags.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is likely pretending to take a more serious stance with their initial statement about being away "some time," but the inclusion of the hashtags shows they are not serious and are perhaps using exaggeration for comedic effect. This playful or casual attitude is reinforced by the hashtags that negate the seriousness of "hibernation."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature:** The speaker implies they are taking a break or will be busy for a while, but the use of hashtags suggests they are not truly hibernating or disappearing.

**Presuppositions:** It's assumed that the audience understands the concept of hibernation as being a long, inactive period and recognizes the playful use of hashtags.

**Intent of the speaker:** The speaker aims to convey a humorous take on being unavailable or taking a short break, probably targeting an audience that appreciates light-hearted banter.

**Polarity:** The tone is light-hearted and playful, rather than serious or negative.

**Pretense:** There's a pretense in pretending to be more serious about leaving temporarily, but the intent is undermined by the humorous hashtags.

**Meaning:** Literally, the statement suggests they'll be away for a while, but the implied meaning through hashtags is that it's not a serious or extended absence.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis:
The initial analysis accurately identifies the speaker's use of humor and sarcasm by using hashtags like "#Hibernot" and "#Not" to diminish the seriousness of their initial claim about being away. The playfulness in the hashtags suggests that they're possibly exaggerating for comedic effect, making it a sarcastic statement.

**Conclusion:** The statement is sarcastic.

"Should I buy these? And become a full time hipster? Lol! #NOT..... http://t.co/bhSSX3lVNh"

- The speaker implies that they are considering purchasing something that they associate with "hipsters," but they do not seem serious about making the purchase. By ending with "#NOT," they suggest that they are dismissing the idea or making fun of it.
- The speaker probably thinks that the idea of buying the item and being a "full time hipster" is humorous or absurd. The use of "Lol!" indicates they find it amusing.
- What the speaker implies and what they think seem to be the same. They are making a joke about the stereotypical style associated with hipsters and indicating they do not plan to seriously consider it.
- The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude but rather genuinely finds the concept amusing and isn't seriously considering the purchase.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Implicature:** The speaker implies that they are not genuinely interested in buying the product and becoming a "full time hipster.” The use of "#NOT" suggests they are dismissing the idea with humor.

**Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that what they are considering buying is typically associated with "hipsters," and that being a "hipster" is an identity that requires a conscious decision or lifestyle choice.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker likely aims to be humorous and to distance themselves from the "hipster" stereotype. They are speaking to an audience who understands the cultural reference and can appreciate the humor in the exaggerated rejection.

**Polarity:** Negative – The use of "#NOT" clearly communicates a negative response to the idea of buying the item or becoming a "hipster."

**Pretense:** There doesn’t seem to be any pretense. The speaker is straightforward in expressing amusement at the concept of becoming a "hipster."

**Meaning:** The literal question of whether they should buy something is overshadowed by the implied meaning that they find the idea laughable and not a serious consideration.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement contains humor and irony, as the speaker juxtaposes their rhetorical question about becoming a "hipster" with the stark denial in the hashtag "#NOT." This contrast creates a sarcastic tone. The statement is sarcastic.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker uses sarcasm to express their frustration about a fire alarm going off at 3AM. The statement implies irritation, as the word "Yay," generally an expression of excitement, is used sarcastically to indicate the opposite feeling. The presupposition is that being woken up or disturbed at 3AM by a fire alarm is not a desirable experience. The intent of the speaker is to voice their annoyance and perhaps seek commiseration from others who might have experienced similar disturbances. The polarity of the statement is negative, given the addition of the hashtag "#not," which emphasizes the sarcasm and the pretense of happiness. There is a stark contrast between the literal and implied meanings, reinforcing the sarcastic tone. Thus, this statement is indeed sarcastic.

The statement "Take me tooooo church #not" suggests a reluctance or lack of desire to go to church, using an exaggerated tone to imply sarcasm. The speaker's intent appears dismissive, expressing a negative opinion about going to church. The term "#not" further reinforces this disinterest or avoidance.

Intent: The speaker aims to convey their disinterest or disdain for the idea of going to church.  
Polarity: The overall tone of the statement is negative regarding going to church.   
Pretense: There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; the sarcasm highlights their genuine disinterest.  
Meaning: The literal request to go to church is contradicted by the implied meaning, which is a strong disapproval of the idea.

The statement is: "You've set yourself some target to achieve there like love #hot or #not http://t.co/IbXXkKRsto"

- The speaker implies that someone has set targets or goals for themselves and compares these endeavors to a game or trend often associated with attractiveness or popularity, as indicated by the hashtags #hot or #not.
- The speaker likely thinks that these targets might be somewhat superficial or trivial, akin to the judgment-based games represented by the hashtags. There may be a hint of sarcasm or playfulness in their tone.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned; both suggest a lighthearted or possibly skeptical view of the significance of these targets.
- The speaker appears to be maintaining a light-hearted or possibly sarcastic attitude, suggesting that they may not be taking the situation entirely seriously.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "You've set yourself some target to achieve there like love #hot or #not" implies a comparison to superficial or trivial goals, as suggested by the hashtags #hot or #not, which are often associated with appearance or popularity judgments. The speaker seems to be presupposing that the targets are not serious or significant. The intent of the speaker appears to be playful, possibly light-heartedly mocking or questioning the seriousness of the goals. The tone is potentially sarcastic due to the implied trivialization. 

The polarity is negative because it suggests skepticism about the significance of the targets. There is pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they might not genuinely regard the targets as significant, despite the literal suggestion of goal setting. The literal meaning refers to setting targets; the implied meaning questions their depth or seriousness.

Upon reflection, the preliminary analysis highlighted the aspects of potential trivialization and sarcasm. Given these elements, the statement can indeed be considered sarcastic, as it implies skepticism about the meaningfulness of the goals in comparison to superficial social trends.

The tweet states: "You could say after today I'm officially necrophelic #LatinFinal #justajoke #notintodeadthings"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that the Latin final exam was extremely difficult or dull, using a hyperbolic comparison to necrophilia to express this sentiment. They also clarify that it is a joke with the hashtags "#justajoke" and "#notintodeadthings," indicating that they are not actually into necrophilia but are making an exaggerated statement to emphasize their frustration or boredom.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely finds the Latin final to be exhausting, mentally draining, or uninspiring, to the point where they liken it to something as extreme and taboo as necrophilia. They are using humor, specifically dark humor, to cope with their feelings about the exam.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication (the exam was extremely tough or boring) and the speaker's thoughts (expressed through their humorous tone) align, suggesting that the speaker is using exaggeration as a way to highlight their experience with the Latin final.

Finally, the speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their use of humor and clarification hashtags suggests they genuinely intend to make a joke about their experience with the exam, rather than adopting a false or misleading attitude.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The tweet implies that the speaker found the Latin final exam to be extremely difficult or boring, comparing it humorously to necrophilia, a topic known for its taboo and extremity. The speaker uses the hashtags "#justajoke" and "#notintodeadthings" to clarify they are joking and do not have an actual interest in necrophilia. This use of hyperbolic humor indicates that the speaker is attempting to express and cope with their feelings of frustration or boredom.

The statements implied by the tweet align with the speaker's personal feelings about the exam, suggesting that they are using dark humor as a coping mechanism. The use of humor and explicit clarification negates any notion of pretense.

Now let's break down whether the tweet is sarcastic:

- The Implicature: The speaker implies their immense frustration or boredom with the exam by comparing it to necrophilia, a shocking and taboo topic.
- The Presuppositions: The statement presupposes that the speaker found the Latin final remarkably difficult or tiresome.
- The intent of the speaker: The speaker intends to humorously express their negative experience with the exam, perhaps seeking empathy or relatability from their audience.
- The polarity: The tone is negative, addressing the weariness or dullness of the exam experience.
- Pretense: There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; their use of humor is genuine.
- Literal vs. Implied Meaning: Literally mentioning necrophilia, yet implying the exam was extremely arduous or boring through humor.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement can be considered sarcastic. Though sarcasm typically includes a layer of irony, the hyperbolic and dark humor presented in a seemingly literal form speaks to a sarcastic tone by juxtapositioning two vastly different subjects (exam and necrophilia) in an exaggerated manner. Therefore, the tweet is sarcastic.

The statement "She talkin bout gender roles and we're the narrow minded ones #Irony" implies that there is a perceived contradiction in that a person who discusses gender roles appears to be calling others narrow-minded. The speaker suggests it is ironic that someone addressing such issues is being hypocritical by not being open-minded themselves. The speaker appears frustrated or dismissive of what they interpret as a self-righteous or closed-minded argument. 

Analyzing the statement:

- **Implicature**: The statement implies irony within the dynamic of discussing gender roles—criticizing others while potentially exhibiting the same faults.

- **Presuppositions**: It assumes a discourse on gender roles is present, along with an accusation of narrow-mindedness leveled against others by the person discussing it.

- **Intent of the speaker**: The speaker aims to highlight perceived hypocrisy and convey their belief that the discussion is not as progressive as it should be.

- **Polarity**: The sentence has a negative tone.

- **Pretense**: There appears to be no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are straightforward in expressing their critique.

- **Meaning**: The implied meaning is that the speaker finds it hypocritical for someone to discuss gender roles and call others narrow-minded.

Based on the analysis, this statement is sarcastic. The speaker uses irony to express criticism, highlighting the contradiction they perceive in the discussion of gender roles. There is genuine critique, but the irony tag suggests the use of sarcasm to make their point more emphatically. The preliminary analysis mostly aligns with this conclusion, though emphasizing the sarcasm more clearly would strengthen it.

The statement is "@CeciAlbiceleste @MarinaOLoughlin #apologies *scoffs humble pie*".

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they need to apologize or admit they were wrong about something, likely directed at Ceci or Marina, by using the phrase "scoffs humble pie," which suggests humility or acknowledging a mistake.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to find the situation amusing or perhaps a bit frustrating, as indicated by the word "scoffs." This could suggest a reluctant but humorous attitude towards admitting their fault or needing to apologize.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Not entirely. While the speaker implies an apology or admission of being wrong, their use of "scoffs" indicates they may not be fully genuine or are doing so with a sense of irony or amusement.

Finally, the speaker is likely pretending to have a humble attitude toward the conversation. The use of "*scoffs*" suggests that while they are making the gesture of humility, they are not entirely sincere about it.

The statement "@CeciAlbiceleste @MarinaOLoughlin #apologies *scoffs humble pie*" is analyzed in terms of sarcastic expression.

**Implicature**: The speaker implies they are making an apology or admitting a mistake directed at the mentioned individuals, Ceci and Marina.

**Presuppositions**: The speaker presupposes that there is something they need to apologize for or admit wrong about, which is also known to Ceci and Marina.

**Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to address a situation that likely involved a mistake or oversight on their part, presumably hoping to exhibit humility. By tagging the individuals, this shows the speaker is directing this communication to them.

**Polarity**: The tone appears negative due to the use of "*scoffs*," which conveys a dismissive or not entirely serious attitude.

**Pretense**: There is pretense in the speaker's attitude, as the act of "scoffing" implies a lack of genuine humility.

**Meaning**: Literally, the speaker is eating "humble pie," a metaphor for admitting wrong, but the implied meaning suggests that the speaker is doing so with insincerity or irony, highlighting the gesture as mocking rather than wholly earnest.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker's intent appears partially facetious, using humor and irony to address their apology, suggesting that, while they recognize the need to offer one, they are not wholly earnest in doing so. Therefore, the statement is considered sarcastic.

The statement is: "I think the general rule is, if it's open all night, pull an all-nighter."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is an attractive encouragement or opportunity to stay up all night if a venue, service, or opportunity is available or accessible during the night.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to think that staying up all night is a rule or norm to be followed in such circumstances. It may imply enthusiasm or excitement about the idea of pulling an all-nighter.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thought align in suggesting that staying up all night is recommended or expected when something is open all night. Both imply a sense of invitation or willingness to seize such an opportunity.

Finally, the statement doesn't appear to indicate the speaker is pretending to have a particular attitude toward the conversation. The statement seems to genuinely express a belief or personal rule without a potentially sarcastic undertone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let's break down the statement based on the provided analysis:

1. **Implicature:** The speaker implies that when an opportunity or service is available 24/7, one should take advantage of it by staying up all night.

2. **Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that the openness of a venue/service throughout the night presents a unique opportunity or incentive that should naturally lead to an all-nighter.

3. **Intent of the speaker:** The speaker, possibly addressing someone familiar with pulling all-nighters or discussing a context where this behavior is common, seems to aim for humor or casual conversational engagement rather than straightforward advice.

4. **Polarity:** The tone appears to be neutral to positive, with a light-hearted or humorous suggestion rather than a serious recommendation.

5. **Pretense:** The statement lacks pretense, as it seems to sincerely express a sentiment without any hidden sarcasm or irony.

6. **Meaning:** Literally, the statement proposes a general rule about staying up all night when things are open. Implied, however, is an informal, possibly humorous suggestion rather than an actual rule or necessity.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement maintains a literal surface meaning that blends easily with an informal conversational tone. Considering this analysis, the statement does not seem sarcastic. The speaker appears to be light-heartedly suggesting a common youthful or adventurous sentiment rather than actually enforcing a strict rule or making a mock suggestion ironically. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker is skeptical and possibly frustrated with the perceived bias they mention. Their use of emojis like the eye-roll (🙈) and hashtag #irony indicates they are being sarcastic, suggesting they do not genuinely believe that Manchester City deserves such favoritism.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement implies that there is favoritism by the Champions League towards Manchester City (MCFC), particularly regarding favorable conditions or draws, which they describe humorously as a "form Scandinavian reef." They express skepticism and frustration, evident in their use of the eye-roll emoji (🙈) and the hashtag #irony, indicating sarcasm. What they imply and think align in expressing frustration about perceived bias. The speaker's use of sarcasm reflects a pretense of humor to cloak their true feelings of criticism. The polarity of the tone is negative, due to the frustration regarding perceived favoritism.

Upon reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it captures the essence of the speaker's sarcasm. The use of humor and irony indicates a dissonance between the literal meaning of a "Scandinavian reef" and the implied criticism of biased treatment for Manchester City. Thus, the statement is indeed sarcastic, aiming to criticize while cloaking the sentiment in humor.

The speaker states, "Sickens me that killing innocent black men & children has become such a lucrative career in America. #MikeBrown #TrayvonMartin #EricGarner"

- The speaker implies that there's a systemic problem in America where the deaths of innocent black men and children have become a profitable or career-driven act, possibly referencing the attention or money tied to these incidents and judicial outcomes.
- The speaker thinks the situation is abhorrent and deeply troubling, as suggested by the use of the word "sickens."

- The speaker does not appear to be pretending; the use of intense language and specific hashtags indicates a genuine and serious attitude toward the subject, expressing frustration and anger regarding the perceived systemic issues.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement implies that there is a systemic issue in America where the killing of innocent black men and children is somehow monetized or incentivized, highlighting prominent cases as examples. The speaker presupposes that the audience understands the cases of Mike Brown, Trayvon Martin, and Eric Garner represent broader racial injustices and that their deaths are part of a disheartening pattern. The speaker's intent is to express frustration and condemn these racial injustices, aiming to raise awareness and critique the perceived profit-driven nature of these tragedies. The use of the word "sickens" conveys a negative tone, and there is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; the sentiment is genuine and serious.

The statement is not sarcastic. The literal meaning aligns with the implied meaning, which is a direct condemnation of systemic racial issues without any hint of irony or sarcasm. The speaker's strong emotional response and serious intent to highlight societal problems suggest a sincere engagement with the topic. Overall, the statement reflects a critical viewpoint aiming to spotlight and challenge racial injustices rather than employing sarcasm.

An 'important' call from the council about a form we did 3 months ago is just what I need an hour before we head off to Disneyland. #not

- The speaker implies that the timing of the call from the council is particularly inconvenient, as they are preparing for a trip to Disneyland. By using the word "important" in quotes and the hashtag "#not," the speaker suggests sarcasm and possibly questions the urgency or necessity of the call.
- The speaker likely finds the situation frustrating or irritating, as the call interrupts their preparations for what seems to be a much-anticipated or enjoyable trip.
- Both the implication and the expressed thought of the speaker indicate dissatisfaction with the timing and relevance of the council's call. The use of sarcasm and the hashtag clearly conveys annoyance or frustration.
- The speaker is not pretending to have a different attitude; their displeasure and sarcasm are openly communicated.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement implies that the call from the council, described as "important," is not actually important or necessary, especially considering the context that the speaker is about to leave for Disneyland. The word "important" in quotes and the hashtag "#not" indicate sarcasm, suggesting the speaker is mocking the supposed importance of the call.

The speaker assumes the reader understands that going to Disneyland is more significant and exciting, and presupposes everyone shares the view that the timing of the call is particularly poor.

The speaker's intent appears to be to express frustration and perhaps seek empathy from a shared experience of dealing with inconvenient bureaucracy. The speaker is likely an individual dealing with council bureaucracy.

The polarity of the statement is negative, highlighted by the use of sarcasm to denote displeasure with the situation.

There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; their frustration is clear and openly communicated.

The literal meaning of the statement is that the call is important, whereas the implied meaning—due to the sarcasm—is that the call's timing is ridiculous and unwelcome.

Given the analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The use of quotes around "important" and the hashtag "#not" are clear markers of sarcasm. The preliminary analysis accurately captured the sarcasm conveyed by the speaker.

- **Implicature**: The speaker is conveying their apprehension about an imagined scenario, suggesting that their fear is triggered by their imagination rather than a real event.
- **Presuppositions**: The speaker's fear is taken as genuine; there's an assumption that such imagined thoughts are enough to incite fear in them.
- **Intent of the speaker**: The speaker likely intends to convey their genuine feeling of fear about what crosses their mind. They are expressing their personal emotion and perhaps seeking understanding or empathy. The speaker is themselves, expressing their thought in a personal context.
- **Polarity**: The tone is negative, as it revolves around fear and being "freaked out."

The statement is: "Really missing my momma today.. More than usual. I don't think today will be a good day."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are feeling a heightened sense of loss or longing for their mother today, more so than they typically do. This emotional state is making them pessimistic about how the rest of their day will go, indicating that the absence of their mother has a significant impact on their well-being.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to think that their emotional state will cast a shadow on their entire day, suggesting that they may not be in the right frame of mind to handle daily tasks or challenges because they are preoccupied with feelings related to missing their mother.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they explicitly state reflect a belief that the day will be negatively affected by their emotional state. The speaker's deeper sense of loss is conveyed in both their implication and explicit statement.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending. Their message seems genuine and openly expresses their feelings and concern about having a challenging day due to their emotional state.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis indicates that the speaker is expressing a genuine sentiment of missing their mother more than usual, which is affecting their outlook on the day. The implicature suggests a heightened emotional state, and the presupposition is that the speaker's mother is not physically present in their life. The speaker hopes to convey their feelings of sadness and longing, likely seeking empathy or support from others.

The polarity of the statement is negative, as it predicts an unfavorable day ahead due to the emotional weight of missing their mother. There is no indication of pretense; the speaker appears authentic in expressing their feelings.

The difference between the literal and implied meanings is minimal in this case. Both convey a sense of longing and pessimism about the day's outcome due to emotional distress.

In this context, the statement is not sarcastic. It is a sincere expression of the speaker's emotions and perspective on their day influenced by personal feelings of loss. The analysis accurately captures the sentiment without the need for adjustments.

**Implicature**: The speaker implies that the notion of studying on a Sunday is contrary to the expected or desired way to spend the day, which is usually associated with rest or leisure activities.

**Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that Sunday is meant for relaxation or enjoyment, not for studying, which is seen as a chore.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that the tribunal is not functioning as a fair or effective oversight mechanism. The use of sarcasm ("#trustthesystem #not") indicates a lack of faith and possibly frustration with how grievances against intelligence services are handled.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks align with each other. Both suggest a disbelief in the tribunal's ability to handle complaints impartially and a general distrust in the system.

The speaker implies that their estate agency is unusual or operates in a strange, avant-garde manner akin to surrealist art. By using the term "surrealist," they suggest that their offerings or services might be unconventional or imaginative, possibly breaking from traditional norms or expectations of what an estate agency typically does.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?  
The speaker appears to view the situation positively, with a touch of humor or whimsy. By juxtaposing the concept of an estate agency, typically associated with business and property, with the art movement known for its bizarre and dream-like qualities, the speaker seems to embrace a non-traditional approach or a playful branding strategy.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?  
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think suggest a sense of novelty and break from convention in their approach to real estate. The playful tone indicates that they find value in being different and perhaps aim to intrigue or amuse their audience.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.

The statement "Welcome to the surrealist estate agency!!" suggests that the speaker is attempting to present their estate agency as an unusual and imaginative alternative to the traditional model, invoking the artistic style of surrealism, known for its dreamlike and unconventional qualities. The implication is that the agency offers unique or unconventional services. The presupposition is that traditional estate agencies are conventional and that this agency breaks from those norms.

The speaker tweeted: "@jthurgood1 @Cameron_Gray republicans suck more at identifying #irony than alanis morissette."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that Republicans struggle to understand or recognize irony and that they are worse at it than they perceive Alanis Morissette to be.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker believes that Republicans have a poor grasp of irony. By referencing Alanis Morissette, they are likely alluding to her song "Ironic," which many critique for incorrectly using examples of irony, suggesting Republicans are even less adept.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the actual thought express skepticism and criticism of Republicans’ ability to comprehend irony. 

Finally, it does not seem like the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. The tone appears genuine and straightforward, aiming for humor through cultural reference.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let's analyze the statement further:

**Implicature:** The speaker implies that Republicans are not good at identifying true irony, using Alanis Morissette as a benchmark due to common critiques of her song "Ironic," which allegedly misuses the concept.

**Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that Alanis Morissette’s song "Ironic" is widely regarded as an example of misunderstanding irony.

**Intent of the Speaker:** The speaker likely aims to criticize Republicans in a humorous way, while engaging with others (possibly to provoke a reaction or agreement).

**Polarity:** The tone of the statement is negative towards Republicans.

**Pretense:** There is no significant pretense; the speaker seems genuine in their criticism, though couched in humor.

**Meaning:** The literal meaning directly states Republicans' inadequacy at recognizing irony compared to Alanis Morissette. The implied meaning is a humorous critique of Republicans’ understanding of irony, exaggerated for effect.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement relies heavily on cultural reference for its humor and critique, indicating an intentional use of sarcasm. The statement employs exaggeration and irony itself to make its point. Thus, the statement is sarcastic.

That moment when the ad plays flawlessly but the video keeps buffering #irony #YouTube @YouTube

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies frustration and annoyance with the situation where advertisements on YouTube are playing without any issues, but the actual content (the video they want to watch) is experiencing buffering problems.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely finds it irritating or unfair that the system prioritizes ad performance over the actual content they wish to consume. They might also be pointing out the irony that the ads, which are often seen as an interruption, work perfectly, while the video, which is the main attraction, does not.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think highlight their frustration with the experience. The use of the hashtag #irony further emphasizes their view of the situation as contradictory and exasperating.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending; their attitude comes across as genuinely frustrated and annoyed, but also a bit humorous with the recognition of irony. This humorous perspective suggests they are taking a light-hearted approach to the situation, despite their irritation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement expresses the speaker's frustration with the situation where YouTube ads always play smoothly, while the content they actually want to watch buffers. The speaker implies annoyance at the perceived prioritization of ads over videos. They highlight the irony of the situation using the hashtag #irony. Both what they imply and think emphasize their exasperation with the experience. The speaker is not pretending to have this attitude; their frustration is genuine, with a touch of humor recognizing the irony. The tone of the statement is negative, given the frustration expressed.

**Analysis:**

1. **The Implicature**: The speaker is frustrated because ads work perfectly while videos don't, implying poor service.
2. **Presuppositions**: It's assumed that ads typically play without issues, as opposed to regular content videos.
3. **Intent**: The speaker wants to highlight the irony and annoyance through a mix of frustration and humor. The speaker likely wants to draw attention to YouTube, the implied listener.
4. **Polarity**: The tone is negative, focusing on the repetitive issue of buffering videos.
5. **Pretense**: There is no pretense; the attitude is authentically frustrated and mildly humorous.
6. **Meaning**: Literal meaning describes the flawless ads vs. buffering videos; implied meaning criticizes the perceived system prioritization issue.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, there appears to be no need for significant changes. The statement is indeed sarcastic, as the branded irony comes from expressing a truth most users find humorous: that ads load perfectly while videos don't. The sarcasm stems from the speaker’s humorously exaggerated frustration highlighting the absurdity of the situation.

The statement tweeted is: "Cook and England rudderless at the death. Seven games and we've got progressively worse! Can't wait 'till they arrive here for WC #sarcasm"

- The speaker implies that England's cricket team, potentially under the leadership of someone named Cook, lacks direction and effectiveness, especially in the closing stages ("at the death") of recent games. They note that the team's performance has deteriorated over a series of seven games.
- The speaker seems frustrated and disappointed with the current state of the team, noting their decline in performance. The use of sarcasm with the phrase "Can't wait 'till they arrive here for WC" implies that they expect the poor performance to continue during the World Cup, which is inferred by "WC."
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are consistent. The implication of declining performance and the sarcastic remark both demonstrate skepticism and dissatisfaction with the team's current direction and prospects.

The speaker is pretending to be enthusiastic ("Can't wait") about England's arrival for the World Cup, using sarcasm to convey the opposite sentiment—that they are not looking forward to the team's arrival or their prospects in the upcoming event.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement comments on England's cricket team, under the leadership of someone named Cook, indicating they lack direction and effectiveness, particularly in the crucial final moments of games ("at the death"). Over seven games, their performance has deteriorated. The tweet ends with "Can't wait 'till they arrive here for WC #sarcasm," implying that despite the literal excitement it predicts, the speaker actually expects further poor performance in the World Cup, showing disappointment and skepticism about the team's prospects. The claim of anticipating England's arrival is sarcastic; the speaker is expressing frustration rather than actual enthusiasm. 

The statement is sarcastic, as the speaker uses irony to mockingly express excitement about an occurrence that they are, in fact, dreading due to the team's poor current form. The analysis should emphasize the negative polarity expressed through sarcasm and the disconnect between the literal and intended meanings.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that having 13 voice mails at work is not actually a pleasant experience, despite the use of the word "lovely," which is intended sarcastically.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely finds the situation overwhelming or frustrating. The use of sarcasm through the hashtag #not suggests that they do not enjoy dealing with a large number of voicemails.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies with their sarcastic remark aligns with what they think about the situation; they both indicate a negative sentiment towards having so many voicemails to address.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude by calling the situation "lovely," but they are doing so sarcastically, which reveals their actual negative attitude.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "13 voice mails at work is always lovely #not" uses sarcasm to express frustration or overwhelm with having a large number of voicemails. The speaker's use of "lovely" is not to be taken literally; instead, it highlights the irony and negative sentiment through the hashtag #not. 

Implicature: The speaker implies that 13 voicemails are anything but lovely, indicating annoyance or frustration. 
Presuppositions: It is taken for granted that receiving 13 voicemails at work is excessive and likely undesirable. 
Intent of the speaker: The speaker aims to express dissatisfaction or frustration, potentially to vent or seek empathy from others on social media.

"I have a very annoying bluetick for sale. 8 yrs old. Needs babied and a bath. #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are frustrated or displeased with their bluetick hound. The mention of the dog's age, neediness, and need for a bath suggests a level of care or attention that they perhaps find burdensome or irritating at the moment.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is likely exaggerating their frustration for comedic effect, as indicated by the use of "#sarcasm." It's possible they aren't seriously considering selling their dog, but rather venting their feelings about the maintenance and attention the dog requires.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
No, they are not saying the same thing. The implication is that the speaker wishes to get rid of the dog due to its requirements, while their thoughts, made clear by the hashtag, suggest they are not actually serious about selling the dog and might simply be making a humorous statement about their situation.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is pretending to be annoyed enough to sell the dog, but the use of sarcasm indicates that this is not their true intention. The tone suggests a lighthearted approach to expressing momentary annoyance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement is intended to be sarcastic, as indicated directly by the "#sarcasm" tag. The speaker is using humor to express momentary annoyance with their bluetick hound by suggesting they might sell it due to its neediness and the effort required for its care. The pretense in their statement is evident because they don't genuinely have the intention to sell the dog; rather, they are humorously venting their feelings. The implicature of the statement is that while they mention selling the dog, it’s not a serious offer but rather a way to express frustration in a comedic manner. The presupposition is that the listener will understand that the speaker is joking, given the context and the hashtag. The polarity of the statement appears to be negative due to the annoyance described, yet this is offset by the lighthearted tone of the sarcasm.

Overall, the speaker's intent seems to be to entertain by making a humorous comment about the challenges of pet ownership, rather than initiating an actual sale. The literal meaning of selling the dog is contrasted by the implied meaning of simply expressing exasperation with a humorous twist. Thus, the analysis correctly identifies the statement as being sarcastic.

The speaker tweeted: "start with India , I need to be somewhere they don't speak great English so I don't have to say much lol"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they want to travel to a place where they won't be expected to engage in conversations due to language barriers. They humorously suggest India as a place where English proficiency is not high, allowing them to speak less.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely has a light-hearted or humorous perspective about their desire not to engage in conversations. They seem to mistakenly or stereotypically perceive that people in India do not speak English fluently.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the thought suggest a preference for being in a place where they can avoid speaking due to perceived language barriers.

The speaker seems to be using humor to express their attitude, possibly exaggerating their perception of English proficiency in India to justify their desire for less conversation. The use of "lol" indicates a casual and humorous tone, suggesting they aren't entirely serious.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker implies a desire to travel to a place where they don't engage in much conversation, humorously identifying India as a location where English is not spoken fluently. The speaker seems to joke about their preference to avoid speaking, with a presupposition that English is not widely or well spoken in India, which reveals a stereotype or misunderstanding. The intent appears to be humorous, as indicated by the use of "lol," and not to genuinely criticize English proficiency in India.

The last sentence holds a playful and casual polarity, and the speaker's attitude suggests pretense due to their exaggeration and stereotyping. The literal meaning refers to traveling to India due to language barriers; whereas, the implied meaning is an exaggerated joke about avoiding conversation. 

Reflecting on this analysis, the statement is sarcastic. It humorously exaggerates the speaker's perception of India's English skills, using sarcasm to make a joke about the desire to speak less. The intent was not to convey a factual assessment of language proficiency, but instead to convey a playful sentiment of seeking solitude through language barriers.

"Most important thing I've learned in school http://t.co/TvfJMGBlBh"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a particular piece of information or lesson that stands out as the most significant learning from their school experience. 

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely holds this particular learning as highly valuable or insightful, given that they have taken the effort to share it as the most important thing learned in school. However, the actual content and attitude towards this lesson might be revealed through the link provided.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
What the speaker implies is that this is an important lesson learned, and what they think could be consistent if they genuinely found the lesson invaluable. However, as the actual content is within a link, this could also lead to a humorous or unexpected type of content, suggesting a more nuanced or even sarcastic undertone.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Without accessing the content of the link, it is not possible to definitively know if the speaker is maintaining a genuine or sarcastic attitude. If the link does lead to something humorous or unexpected, it might suggest that the speaker is using irony or humor, thereby pretending to have a certain seriousness in the statement.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Preliminary Analysis Summary:

The speaker is suggesting that they have learned something particularly significant in school, highlighting their intention to share this important lesson. However, the actual sentiment behind this claim hinges on the content of the link, which could potentially be humorous or unexpected, leading to the possibility of sarcasm. This creates ambiguity in their true attitude because while they appear to present a genuine statement, the link content may reveal a sarcastic or ironic undertone.

Analysis for Sarcasm Determination:

1. **The Implicature**: The speaker implies they have learned something important from school, but given the commonality of sarcastic statements online, the link could redirect to something trivial, indicating sarcasm.

2. **The Presuppositions**: It is presumed that the speaker values education and has gained significant insights from schooling. Yet, this is called into question without knowing the link's content.

3. **The Intent of the Speaker**: The intent might be humor or irony, entertaining their audience with the contrast between the expectation of something valuable and the reality of the link content.

4. **The Polarity**: The tone appears neutral in the literal text; however, linking to unrelated or trivial content would create a negative or ironic contrast.

5. **Pretense**: It is likely there is pretense if the link content contradicts the seriousness implied in the statement.

6. **Meaning**: The implied meaning—valuable school lesson—could differ drastically from what the link actually presents, suggesting the importance is exaggerated or mocked.

Final Evaluation:

Given the potential for the link to lead to humorous or trivial content, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is likely sarcastic. The literal meaning suggests an important lesson, but without context, the implied meaning hints at the possibility of an ironic or playful critique on school learnings. The analysis suggests that if the link’s content presents a stark contrast to the implied value, sarcasm is indeed at play.

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a discussion or concern regarding the relationship between Juncker's investment plan and cohesion policies, which seems to be discussed or clarified by Commissioner Creu to the Committee of the Regions. 

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears to view the situation as noteworthy or potentially significant, enough to mention it in a tweet, though the full context or specifics of what reassurances were provided aren't included. The use of hashtags suggests they consider this relevant to broader ongoing discussions or debates related to European Union policies. 

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the implications and the speaker's thoughts both acknowledge a link between Juncker's investment plan and cohesion policies, and that this link needed clarification or reassurance. The speaker presents this issuance of reassurance or clarification as a point of interest.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Based on the language and style of the tweet, there's no strong indication that the speaker is pretending or altering their attitude. The tweet seems more informational and straightforward rather than editorializing or injecting personal attitude into it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker in the statement is providing an informational update about European Union policies, specifically mentioning that Commissioner Creu is reassuring the Committee of the Regions about the compatibility of Juncker's investment plan with cohesion policies. The use of hashtags and the structure of the tweet indicate that the speaker considers this information relevant and significant within broader EU-related discussions. The implication here is that there might have been concerns or discussions about how these two initiatives align, prompting the need for reassurance.

The presupposition is that the audience is aware of the ongoing discussions or concerns regarding these policies, and the speaker assumes the audience will understand the significance of this reassurance. The intent of the speaker seems to be informing others about this development, particularly those interested in European Union affairs.

The polarity of the tweet is neutral to slightly positive, as it suggests reassurance and complementarity without expressing any explicit negative sentiment. There is no evident pretense in the speaker's attitude; it appears straightforward and factual.

The literal meaning of the tweet is that Commissioner Creu has reassured the Committee of the Regions about the investment plan's role alongside cohesion policies. The implied meaning is that this reassurance was needed due to prior concerns or discussions.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, there appears to be no indication of sarcasm in the statement. The language used is factual and the intent is to inform, with no evidence of irony or contradiction between the literal and intended meanings. The statement is not sarcastic.

The tweet states, "when you refer to yourself in the plural, you'll get that @RBRNetwork1 @billvanglahn @HondoLane @Dolphin__Man @jus1314tin @SpringThunder."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker seems to imply that referring to oneself in the plural is possibly well-understood or acknowledged by the tagged users or that the tagged users will appreciate or understand the reference or action.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely thinks that referring to oneself in the plural is something noticeable or significant enough to catch the attention of the mentioned users, possibly implying humor or an insider joke amongst them.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both imply a shared understanding or common knowledge among the tagged individuals that being referred to in plural form is an identifiable or noteworthy action, presumably understood as humorous or significant in some way.

The speaker might be pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation—perhaps suggesting a sense of familiarity or camaraderie with the mentioned users. However, without further context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of their attitude beyond a shared understanding or in-joke.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis of the tweet suggests the speaker implies that referring to oneself in the plural is a concept understood or appreciated by the tagged users, possibly as an insider joke or shared understanding. The statement takes for granted that the mentioned users will recognize this reference. The speaker's intent might be to foster a sense of camaraderie or humor with the tagged individuals by referencing something shared among them.

The tone of the last sentence is neutral, not explicitly positive or negative. There may be some pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they adopt a tone of inside knowledge or familiarity with the group. The literal meaning of the statement is about referring to oneself in the plural, but the implied meaning is that this action has a specific, perhaps humorous, significance among the tagged users.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement might not be highly sarcastic. It seems more like an attempt to engage or connect with the mentioned users through a shared understanding or joke. Thus, the statement is not sarcastic, as there is no conflicting literal and implied meaning indicating sarcasm.

The tweet states: "http://t.co/PfJ92w4CwZ #TeenAnalCasting #Top Top 50 Christian Songs For 2012"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is sharing a link and pairing two seemingly unrelated hashtags: "#TeenAnalCasting" and "#Top Top 50 Christian Songs For 2012". This could imply a potential mistake, humor, or critique by juxtaposing an adult themed tag with a list of Christian songs.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker could be making an intentional joke or statement about incongruity, contrasting the adult-themed hashtag with a hashtag representing Christian values. Alternatively, it could be a mishap or an automated post without the speaker’s conscious intervention in combining these themes.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
If the speaker is purposefully contrasting these hashtags, both the implication and their thoughts align, mocking or highlighting an absurd situation. However, if this combination was unintentional, the speaker's thoughts likely do not align with the implication.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
If intentional, the speaker might be pretending to be serious while actually being ironic or humorous about the stark contrast between the hashtags. If unintentional, the speaker likely isn’t presenting any pretense and may correct this upon realization.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Preliminary Analysis Summary:**

The tweet juxtaposes two seemingly unrelated hashtags: #TeenAnalCasting and #Top Top 50 Christian Songs For 2012. This contrast implies a potential joke or critique by aligning an adult-themed hashtag with a hashtag representing Christian values. The speaker might be intentionally creating a humorous or absurd situation, or it could be an unintentional error or automated post without aware intervention. The speaker's intent can be seen as mocking or highlighting the incongruity if intentional, or accidental if unintentional. If intentional, there may be pretense with the speaker appearing serious but actually being ironic. If unintentional, there is likely no pretense, and the speaker might correct the error once realized.

**Decision on Sarcasm:**

1. **The Implicature:** The tweet suggests a humorous or critical stance by placing disparate topics (adult content and Christian songs) together, which is likely intended to be perceived as absurd or mocking.

2. **The Presuppositions:** The tweet takes for granted that audience will notice the stark contrast and find humor or confusion in it, assuming awareness of both the adult-themed and Christian contexts.

3. **The Intent of the Speaker:** If intentional, the speaker aims to achieve humor or critique by playing on the irony of the situation. If unintentional, it serves as an unfortunate error in hashtag use.

4. **The Polarity:** The polarity of this tweet can be perceived as negative due to the nature of the first hashtag, but more likely when viewed as sarcasm, it carries a humorous tone.

5. **Pretense:** There is potential for pretense if this was intentional, as the speaker would be feigning seriousness to highlight the irony.

6. **Meaning:** The literal meaning includes both hashtags as topics for the link, but the implied meaning suggests humor or critique of the juxtaposition.

Reflecting on the analysis, the speaker likely uses sarcasm if intentionally pairing the hashtags. The mismatched themes and possible humor indicate an ironic tone rather than a simple information-sharing message. Therefore, if intentional, the statement is sarcastic.

The statement to analyze is: "Why is there evidence of a stripper in my house yet I see no stripper in my house 😑💔"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there are signs or traces of a stripper having been in their house, such as items or clues that suggest a stripper had been there, but they did not personally witness or encounter the person associated with these signs. The tone conveys confusion or frustration about the situation.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to be bewildered and perhaps slightly amused or annoyed by the discrepancy between the evidence and the reality of the situation—expecting to see a stripper due to the evidence, yet not finding one in actuality. The emojis used (😑💔) suggest a combination of disappointment or exasperation and mild heartache.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are aligned. They are expressing confusion about the situation, wondering why there are signs of a stripper when no stripper is present, and their thought process is questioning the inconsistency between evidence and reality.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Based on the statement and the use of emojis, it does not seem like the speaker is pretending to have a different attitude. Their use of humor and emojis reflects a genuine mix of confusion and mild distress.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement, which humorously recounts a puzzling situation, implies that there's evidence suggesting the presence of a stripper in the speaker's house, yet they have not actually seen a stripper there. The speaker seems to be expressing bewilderment and possibly slight amusement, hinted by the use of emojis that convey disappointment or exasperation. The statement's tone is neither pretending nor disingenuous; the emojis underscore a genuine reaction. The conveyed emotion is mostly aligned with the speaker’s thoughts of questioning the inconsistency between physical evidence and actual presence.

In terms of analysis:

- **Implicature**: The speaker is implying confusion or intrigue about the situation - there's supposed evidence of a stripper but no actual stripper in sight.
- **Presuppositions**: The audience understands what kind of evidence might suggest the presence of a stripper.
- **Intent of the speaker**: Likely to entertain or elicit amusement from the audience by sharing this quirky situation.
- **Polarity**: The emojis suggest a negative tone, indicating mild distress or disappointment.
- **Pretense**: There does not appear to be pretense; the speaker genuinely seems perplexed or amused.
- **Meaning**: The literal meaning is about physical evidence and absence, but the implied meaning presents the speaker's amusement or exasperation over this odd discrepancy.

Reflecting on this, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The use of emojis and the peculiar nature of the evidence-reality mismatch suggests an underlying humorous commentary, understanding the absurdity of the situation. The literal interpretation doesn't capture the full nuance or the humorous intent, which is crucial in detecting sarcasm.

The statement is: "Pips who drop out of school n have Kirya as 'eir role model tht ey wana sing too..guy spix Portuguese,French,english...#Not a school dropout."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that individuals who might drop out of school with the hopes of becoming singers like Kirya should reconsider, as Kirya is not a school dropout and is multilingual, which suggests a level of education and sophistication.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to think that the notion of dropping out of school to pursue a singing career, especially using Kirya as a justification, is flawed since Kirya himself has a robust educational background.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both imply and explicitly state that dropping out isn't the ideal path to emulate Kirya, as his multilingual skills indicate he pursued education.

The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a certain attitude. They genuinely seem to express concern that aspiring singers should not drop out of school thinking it aligns with their role model's journey.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement discusses the idea of people dropping out of school to become singers, thinking they are following in the footsteps of a role model named Kirya. The speaker implies that this is a misguided approach because Kirya, their role model, is multilingual and presumably well-educated, indicating that he did not drop out of school himself.

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies that aspiring singers should not emulate a role model by dropping out, as the role model, Kirya, is successful due to his education and multilingual abilities, not in spite of them.

- **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that Kirya is an admired figure for young aspiring musicians and being multilingual indicates having a good education.

- **Intent of the speaker**: The speaker hopes to dissuade others from dropping out of school, using Kirya's educational background as evidence that education contributes to success.

- **Polarity**: The tone is negative regarding the idea of dropping out of school.

- **Pretense**: There is no pretense; the speaker's attitude reflects genuine concern for the decisions of aspiring singers.

- **Meaning**: The literal meaning discusses fans of Kirya aspiring to be singers. The implied message is that these fans should value education as Kirya does, instead of assuming they need to drop out to succeed as singers.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it accurately identifies the speaker's genuine belief that staying in school is important, avoiding any sarcasm. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker sincerely advises against dropping out by highlighting that Kirya's success includes his education.

The statement to analyze is: "The #irony is anti state ppl will claim the little man (hacker) won when in reality the state won #sony."

- The speaker implies that there is a contradiction in how people perceive the situation. They suggest that while some people, specifically those who are against the state, believe that the "little man" or hacker has won, the reality is that it was actually the state that emerged victorious.
- The speaker seems to think that the perception held by "anti-state people" is misguided or incorrect. They appear to be highlighting a discrepancy between what some people believe and what the speaker sees as the true outcome, which is that the state was the real winner.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think is essentially the same. They both suggest a belief that the public perception held by anti-state individuals is incorrect and that the state was the actual victor.

The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. They seem genuine in their assertion of irony in the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement implies that anti-state individuals misinterpret the situation by claiming a victory for the hacker, whereas the speaker believes the state actually triumphed. This creates a sense of irony since the perceived outcome is contrary to reality, according to the speaker. 

The speaker presupposes that there is a common narrative among anti-state people that celebrates the hacker as victorious. Their intent is to point out this irony and highlight the discrepancy between perception and reality. The speaker is likely addressing those who are familiar with the events surrounding #sony and the broader context of anti-state sentiment.

The polarity of the statement is neutral to negative, as it critiques the anti-state perspective. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are straightforward in expressing their viewpoint.

The literal meaning is that anti-state people claim the hacker won, while the implied meaning is that this belief is ironic because the state actually prevailed.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is sarcastic because the speaker uses irony to express how anti-state people's perception is supposedly incorrect. The use of the hashtag "#irony" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the subject in question does not have prominent or noticeable breasts. The use of "hmmmm" and the smiley emoji "😁" suggests a casual or playful tone, implying some level of lightheartedness or humor.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to think that the subject's breasts are not significant in size or not the primary notable feature. The tone of the statement suggests that the speaker is not taking the situation seriously.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts suggest a similar view—that the subject does not have noteworthy breasts—and both are conveyed with a playful or teasing attitude.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending. The casual and humorous tone is consistent with a genuine, relaxed perspective on the topic being discussed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Summary of Preliminary Analysis:
The statement "hmmmm. I wouldn't say she has tits 😁" suggests that the speaker is implying the subject lacks prominent breasts. The speaker uses a playful tone, indicated by "hmmmm" and the smiley emoji, to imply humor rather than seriousness. The analysis points out that the speaker's implication and thoughts align, both indicating a casual perspective on the topic. There is no pretense detected in the speaker's attitude as the lighthearted tone seems genuine.

Analysis Reflection and Decision:
- **Implicature**: The speaker implies the subject's lack of prominent breasts is not serious or noteworthy.
- **Presuppositions**: The context assumes that the discussion or observation about breast size is known or of interest to the audience involved.
- **Intent**: The speaker likely hopes to engage humorously with their audience, possibly in a teasing or joking manner about the subject's physical attributes.
- **Polarity**: Neutral to positive, due to the use of humor.
- **Pretense**: There doesn't seem to be pretense; the speaker's casual tone appears genuine.
- **Meaning**: While the literal meaning questions the subject's breast size, the implied meaning trivializes the subject's physical trait through humorous commentary.

Considering these factors, the statement can be interpreted as sarcastic because there is an underlying irony. The playful denial of the subject having "tits" when using terms like "hmmmm" and a smiley emoji suggests a sarcastic commentary on a perceived norm or expectation about physical appearance. Thus, the statement is sarcastic.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; rather, they are using sarcasm to express their true feelings of negativity or dread about the day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Today is going to be a great day . #not. 😔" shows clear signs of sarcasm. The speaker implies that the day will actually not be great, contradicting the literal interpretation of the initial positive statement. The use of the hashtag "#not" and a sad emoji emphasizes this negative outlook, making it clear that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe the day will be good.

Presupposition-wise, the statement assumes the listener understands sarcasm, which flips the meaning of the initial phrase. The speaker's intent appears to be expressing dissatisfaction or pessimism about the day's outlook, possibly to share their feelings with others or evoke empathy.

The polarity of the statement is negative due to the hashtag "#not" and the sad emoji. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; the sarcasm straightforwardly communicates their actual pessimism.

Overall, the analysis captures the essence of the statement well, confirming its sarcastic nature. The literal and implied meanings are opposites, with the sarcasm directly revealing the speaker's true negative expectations for the day. There's no need for further changes to the initial analysis, as it accurately identifies the statement as sarcastic.

"HELLO Wednesday! BY THE WAY IT'S December 10, 2014 at 02:15PM! (just a random information)"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are acknowledging the day of the week, Wednesday, and also providing a seemingly inconsequential piece of information about a past date and time, which suggests a casual or light-hearted approach.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely thinks that sharing this information is a humorous or trivial remark that doesn't carry any significant meaning. They mention the date as "just a random information," which indicates that they don't expect others to find it important or relevant.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the speaker implies that the information is random and unnecessary, which aligns with their likely thought that it's just a playful or humorous interjection.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker seems genuine in their light-hearted approach and doesn't appear to be pretending to have a different attitude. They are likely trying to engage in a fun, humor-filled manner by presenting trivial information.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis indicates that the statement is light-hearted and playful, intending to engage humorously by sharing seemingly trivial information. The speaker implies that mentioning the date and time is inconsequential, and they acknowledge it as "just a random information," suggesting that it might not be of any particular importance. This aligns with the speaker's likely perspective that the information is humorous or trivial. There's no indication of pretense, as the speaker seems genuine in their playful approach.

To determine whether the statement is sarcastic, let's reflect on the key aspects:

- **Implicature**: The speaker is casually bringing attention to a date and time, which is taken out of context and therefore humorous.
- **Presuppositions**: Sharing the date and time assumes that the audience understands it is not relevant.
- **Intent**: The speaker aims to amuse or lightly engage with the audience.
- **Polarity**: The tone is positive, intended to amuse rather than criticize.
- **Pretense**: There appears to be no pretense; the speaker is genuine in their approach.
- **Meaning**: The literal sharing of a date/time differs from the implied humor or randomness in context.

The speaker's statement isn’t sarcastic, as there isn’t a contrast between what is said and what is implied in the form of irony; rather, it's a straightforward, humorous remark.

The speaker states, "if Christian expects Fifa to sleep in my bed with me tonight, he's wrong 👿"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is an expectation from someone named Christian for a person or possibly a pet named Fifa to share the bed with the speaker. The use of the devil emoji suggests frustration or anger towards this expectation.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to think that the expectation from Christian is unreasonable or unwelcome. The speaker is clearly against the idea of Fifa sleeping in their bed.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think align. The speaker implies Christian has an expectation that the speaker does not agree with, and the statement shows their opposition to this idea.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending and seems genuine in their expression of irritation or defiance towards the expectation posed by Christian.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**The Implicature:**
The speaker implies that Christian has an expectation regarding Fifa that the speaker finds unacceptable. The use of the devil emoji suggests frustration or anger at the prospect of Fifa sharing the bed.

**The Presuppositions:**
It is taken for granted that Christian expects Fifa to sleep in the speaker's bed and that Fifa refers to a person or a pet.

**The Intent of the Speaker:**
The speaker aims to assertively reject Christian's expectation and express irritation. The speaker is likely addressing a broader audience, possibly their social media followers, to convey their stance humorously or dramatically.

**The Polarity:**
The tone of the last sentence is negative, signified by the devil emoji and the firm declaration against Christian's expectation.

**Pretense:**
There does not appear to be pretense. The speaker genuinely expresses their displeasure and opposition to the situation.

**Meaning:**
The literal meaning is that Christian is wrong in his expectation about the sleeping arrangement. The implied meaning is that the speaker strongly opposes this expectation and is not willing to accommodate it.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, nothing substantial should change. The statement is not sarcastic because it straightforwardly communicates frustration without any indication of irony or opposite intent. The speaker genuinely opposes the expectation and uses exaggerated language and emoji to reinforce their stance rather than to imply a different sentiment.

The tweet by the user asks, "How many of those jobs earn #middleclass wages? #Economics #Math #Z"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that while there may be a significant number of jobs being discussed in the context of the original conversation, the quality or wage level of these jobs is questionable. Specifically, they are concerned with how many of these jobs actually provide middle-class wages, suggesting that there's a possibility that many of them do not.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker appears to be skeptical about the quality of jobs being referenced, indicating a belief that not all job growth translates to economic improvement for the average worker. They seem to be looking for a discussion or statistics that correlate job creation with the actual financial well-being of the workforce.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the explicit thought relate to a concern over job quality and wages. The speaker implies doubt about the qualitative value of the jobs, and their skepticism aligns with their underlying thought that many jobs might not meet middle-class income standards.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Just paid $2.59 for gas! #ThanksObama #sarcasm

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is implying that the price of gas being $2.59 is considered relatively inexpensive or favorable, at least from their perspective.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is likely expressing satisfaction or surprise at the low price of gas. The hashtag "#ThanksObama #sarcasm" suggests that they are sarcastically attributing the low gas prices to former President Obama, implying a disconnection between his policies and the current gas prices.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the speaker's implication and their actual thoughts are aligned in recognizing the low price, but the use of sarcasm indicates they do not genuinely credit Obama for the situation.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
Yes, the speaker is using sarcasm to pretend to credit Obama for the favorable gas price, highlighting a humorous or ironic detachment from the notion that a former president is directly responsible for the current price.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement, "Just paid $2.59 for gas! #ThanksObama #sarcasm," is sarcastic. The implied meaning is different from the literal content; though they mention a thank-you to Obama, the hashtag "#sarcasm" clarifies that this is not a genuine attribution. The speaker suggests that gas prices being $2.59 are notably low and enjoyable, yet the sarcastic tag indicates that they're jokingly criticizing the common tendency to either blame or credit political figures for economic conditions that aren't entirely in their control. 

The presupposition in this context is that the price of gas is a significant topic of discussion possibly linked to political influence. The speaker intends to entertain by highlighting the absurdity of attributing everyday events such as fluctuating gas prices directly to former presidents' policies. 

The polarity of the statement is positive, as the price is low, but negative in tone due to sarcasm. There is a pretense in the speaker's attitude as they're acting as if they believe Obama is responsible for the low prices, while, in truth, they're making light of such simplistic attributions.

Upon reflecting on the analysis, it confirms the statement as sarcastic by contrasting the literal thanks with the implied disbelief and jest. The initial analysis is comprehensive and accurate, evaluating all facets of the sarcasm effectively.

The statement "@onedirection guys!!! you've just smashed it!! #WhereDoBrokenHeartsGo #XFactorFinal" is an expression of excitement and admiration. The speaker implies that One Direction delivered an outstanding performance on the X Factor Final, using the phrase "smashed it" to convey exceptional success.

The literal and implied meanings align, as both express a strong approval of the performance.

The statement is: "It's all about Twitter #not a clue"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a discussion or focus on Twitter, but they are unclear or uncertain about it.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems confused or disconnected from the ongoing conversation about Twitter. There is a sense of not understanding or having insight into what is happening.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?

The speaker does not seem to be pretending; their confusion or lack of understanding seems genuine.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Reflecting on the preliminary analysis:

**The Implicature**: The statement implies that there is significant discussion or attention being given to Twitter, yet the speaker feels lost or uninformed.

**The Presuppositions**: It is assumed that Twitter is the focal point of the conversation and that understanding or insight about it is expected.

**The Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to convey their lack of understanding or connection with the current focus on Twitter. The speaker is likely someone who feels out of depth with the topic being discussed.

**The Polarity**: The tone of the last part "#not a clue" has a negative inclination, reflecting confusion or lack of awareness.

**Pretense**: There doesn't seem to be any pretense. The speaker's confusion comes across as genuine, not as an act.

**Meaning**: Literally, the speaker acknowledges a focus on Twitter, but the hashtag "#not a clue" implies they have no understanding or grasp of the situation. The implied meaning contrasts with the acknowledgment of Twitter; it focuses on their personal lack of comprehension.

Based on the analysis, the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker's tone genuinely reflects a lack of understanding rather than employing irony or sarcasm. The preliminary analysis could have been clearer on the fact that there's no pretense involved and that the speaker genuinely appears to be expressing their confusion. The authenticity of their confusion should be highlighted to avoid misinterpretation of sarcasm.

"Trying to eat crackers on the quiet floor likeee.. Maybe if I chew slower no one will notice..#not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker is implying that they are in a situation where they are eating crackers on a designated quiet floor, likely in a library or study area, and they are trying to be discreet about it. However, they are aware that eating crackers is inherently noisy and difficult to do quietly.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to find the situation humorous and a bit awkward. They appear to be acknowledging the futility of trying to eat quietly in a quiet space, as indicated by the use of "#not," which implies that they know their efforts to be unnoticed are not successful.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. They're both focused on the humor and awkwardness of attempting to eat a noisy snack quietly in a quiet setting.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending to have a different attitude. They genuinely seem to find the situation amusing and are expressing their true thoughts about the infeasibility of eating crackers quietly on the quiet floor.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Summary of Preliminary Analysis:**

The statement involves someone eating crackers on a quiet floor, presumably in a setting like a library. The use of "#not" indicates the speaker's acknowledgement that their attempt to eat quietly is ineffective. The underlying implication is the contrast between the noisy act of eating crackers and the requirement for silence on the quiet floor. The speaker’s intent is to share the humor and awkwardness of the situation with others, likely on social media. The literal meaning of trying to chew slower does not align with the implied meaning revealed by "#not"—indicating the attempt will be unsuccessful.

**Analysis for Sarcasm:**

- **Implicature:** The speaker implies that quiet snacking efforts are futile.
- **Presuppositions:** It is assumed that everyone understands the norm of silence on the 'quiet floor' and the challenge of eating quietly.
- **Intent:** The speaker wants to share the humor in their awkward situation.
- **Polarity:** The tone is light-hearted and humorous, which is generally positive.
- **Pretense:** The speaker isn't hiding their true feelings; they convey their honest amusement.

Given this analysis, the statement is sarcastic. The use of "#not" directly contradicts the notion that chewing slower will silence their snacking, revealing the sarcasm in acknowledging the humorous futility of their situation. The implicit message is intentionally opposite to give a comedic effect, typical of sarcasm.

"Rejoice in knowing he is now in his new place...#not easy"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that while there is some positive aspect to "he" being in his new place, it is still a difficult situation to handle or come to terms with. The use of the hashtag "#not easy" suggests that there are underlying challenges or emotional complexities that make it hard to fully celebrate or accept.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely feels conflicted. On one hand, they see a reason to rejoice, possibly because the new place is a better scenario for "he." However, on the other hand, the situation also carries difficulty or sadness, making it tough to purely celebrate.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both imply a conflict between recognizing a positive development and dealing with the emotional or complex difficulties tied to it. The speaker is transparent about the mixed emotions surrounding the situation. 

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not seem to be pretending; rather, they are openly expressing the mixed feelings involved, revealing a genuine struggle to reconcile rejoicing with difficulty.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the speaker is expressing mixed emotions about someone moving to a new place. While there's an acknowledgment that this is a positive development, the hashtag "#not easy" reveals underlying challenges and emotional complexities. The speaker is open about the struggle to reconcile these mixed feelings, indicating sincerity in their expression.

To determine sarcasm:
- **The Implicature**: The speaker implies that the new place has benefits, but there's also a significant hardship in adjusting or accepting it.
- **The Presuppositions**: It's taken for granted that moving to a new place generally signals improvement or transition.
- **The intent of the speaker**: The speaker aims to communicate the internal conflict about the situation, showing both recognition of positives and acknowledgment of the difficulties involved.
- **The polarity**: The sentence has a negative tone due to the mention of difficulty.
- **Pretense**: There is no pretense; the speaker appears genuine in expressing their emotions.
- **Meaning**: The literal meaning is to celebrate the person's new place, but the implied meaning reveals it's challenging to feel purely happy due to existing complexities.

Based on the analysis, the statement does not appear to be sarcastic. The speaker genuinely expresses the emotional conflict, without mockery or irony. Therefore, the preliminary analysis aligns with the conclusion that the statement isn't sarcastic and does not require changes.

The speaker tweeted: "@Esmerodo @MonteMcNaughton @MacLeodLisa Yes, and conventional taxis drive verrrry safely. #pfft #sarcasm"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that conventional taxis do not, in fact, drive very safely. The use of extended "verrrry" and the hashtags "#pfft #sarcasm" suggest that the statement is sarcastic.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker thinks that conventional taxis are not particularly safe in their driving, likely as a commentary against any suggestions that they might be safer than alternatives like ride-sharing services or automated vehicles.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, the speaker is implying and expressing the same skepticism about the safety of conventional taxis.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is clearly using sarcasm to convey their actual attitude about the safety of conventional taxis, so they are not pretending to have a different attitude. Their sarcasm directly reflects their critical perspective on the issue.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The analysis explains that the speaker uses sarcasm to criticize the notion that conventional taxis drive safely. The literal statement ("conventional taxis drive verrrry safely") is contradicted by the implied meaning, which is that they do not drive safely. The speaker's intent is to challenge or mock the assumption of taxi safety, as indicated by the elongated "verrrry" and the hashtags "#pfft #sarcasm," which underscore the sarcastic tone. The speaker does not pretend to have an attitude other than skepticism and criticism regarding taxi safety.

This analysis concludes that the tweet is sarcastic because the literal and implied meanings diverge; the speaker’s use of sarcasm intends to voice criticism of conventional taxi safety. Therefore, the statement is indubitably sarcastic.

"#HowToGetUnfollowed Post pictures or videos of you smoking. Especially blowing smoke at the camera. #SoCool #Not #GTFO"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that posting pictures or videos of oneself smoking, particularly with the act of blowing smoke at the camera, is considered distasteful and a surefire way to lose followers on social media.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker clearly disapproves of the behavior and considers it uncool or unattractive. The use of hashtags like "#SoCool #Not #GTFO" suggests sarcasm and an outright rejection of the act as something commendable or worthy of social media attention.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the speaker's implication and thoughts align. The sarcasm in their statement and hashtags convey their disapproval, making it clear that they dislike such content and perceive it as a reason to unfollow someone.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is not pretending to have an attitude; they are genuinely expressing their disdain for people who post smoking-related content on social media. The sarcasm used underscores their true feelings about the subject.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement critiques people who post pictures or videos of themselves smoking on social media, specifically when they blow smoke at the camera. The speaker implies that such actions are unattractive and will lead to losing followers, as suggested by the hashtag "#HowToGetUnfollowed." The use of additional hashtags "#SoCool #Not #GTFO" indicates a sarcastic tone, mocking the idea that smoking can be seen as cool.

- **Implicature**: Posting images of smoking is uncool and leads to social media disengagement (unfollowers).
- **Presuppositions**: The audience values having followers and does not want to lose them.
- **Intent**: The speaker aims to criticize and dissuade people from posting such content by highlighting its unattractiveness. The speaker is presumably someone who dislikes smoking-related posts.
- **Polarity**: Negative tone; the statement expresses disapproval.
- **Pretense**: The speaker does not pretend; their use of sarcasm reveals genuine disdain for smoking-related content.
- **Meaning**: The literal suggestion of losing followers contrasts with the deeper disdain for smoking content and its perceived lack of coolness.

Reflecting on the analysis, the statement uses sarcasm, as evidenced by the #SoCool #Not hashtags. The speaker's intent, alongside the negative polarity and lack of pretense, confirms the sarcastic nature of the statement.

"People who tell people with anxiety to 'just stop worrying about it' are my favorite kind of people #not #educateyourself"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that telling someone with anxiety to simply "stop worrying" is an unhelpful and ignorant response. By using the sarcastic phrase "my favorite kind of people" followed by "#not", the speaker suggests that they find this approach frustrating and possibly offensive.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that people who advise those with anxiety to "just stop worrying" lack understanding and need to educate themselves about anxiety. They likely believe that anxiety is a complex mental health issue that cannot be dismissed so easily.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. Both suggest that the speaker is critical of simplistic advice given to people with anxiety and believes more understanding and education are needed.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm to express their attitude, as indicated by the hashtag "#not," which shows that they do not genuinely regard those individuals as their favorites. Instead, they are likely frustrated or irritated by such simplistic advice.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "People who tell people with anxiety to 'just stop worrying about it' are my favorite kind of people #not #educateyourself" is analyzed in terms of sarcasm. 

**Implicature**: The speaker implies that simply telling someone with anxiety to "stop worrying" is ignorant and unhelpful. 

**Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that advising people with anxiety in such a way is a common occurrence and is not effective.

**Intent of the speaker**: The speaker aims to criticize those who offer simplistic advice to individuals with anxiety and urges for better understanding and education through hashtags.

**Polarity**: The use of "#not" gives a negative tone, indicating disapproval.

**Pretense**: There is pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they use sarcasm to mask their frustration and disagreement.

**Meaning**: The literal statement suggests approval of people who give the advice "stop worrying," but the implied meaning, revealed through sarcasm and hashtags, conveys disdain and calls for better awareness.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it correctly identifies the sarcastic nature of the statement. Therefore, the statement should be determined as sarcastic because the speaker does not genuinely regard people who give simplistic advice for anxiety as their favorite but instead criticizes them.

The statement is: "I'm giving up a lot of stuff to make sure others are happy. I wonder if anyone ever looks past my appearance and see what I'm feeling 😩"

- The speaker implies that they are making sacrifices or compromising their own needs or desires to please others, and they feel that their own feelings and emotional wellbeing are being overlooked.
- The speaker thinks that the situation is imbalanced and possibly unappreciated. They feel that their personal sacrifices are not being acknowledged or understood by others.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the speaker is expressing genuine frustration and longing for emotional recognition. 

- **Implicature**: The statement implies that the speaker feels underappreciated and desires acknowledgment of their sacrifices and feelings beyond surface appearances. 
- **Presuppositions**: The speaker assumes that others are not currently recognizing their emotional state and that their appearance is what primarily represents them to others.
- **Intent**: The speaker aims to share their feelings of self-neglect and desire for recognition, probably with their social circle or anyone willing to listen.

- The speaker implies that they are, in fact, not happy about being ignored. The use of "😊" followed by "#not" and "😒" conveys sarcasm and frustration.
- The speaker thinks that the situation of being ignored is unpleasant and possibly hurtful. They are expressing discontent with how they are being treated.

The analysis suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic with their statement "I just love being ignored," as indicated by the added "#not" and "😒" emoji. The implicature reveals that the speaker is unhappy about being ignored, contrary to what the literal words suggest. The presupposition is that the speaker is in a situation where they feel overlooked or neglected, and this is taken as inherently negative. The speaker's intent is to convey their displeasure and possibly elicit a response or change in behavior from the intended audience. The polarity of the statement is negative, given the use of the sarcastic hashtag and emoji. There is no pretense; the sarcasm directly communicates the speaker's dissatisfaction.

"Planning a vacation instead of studying.... My priorities are in line. #NOT"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that planning a vacation instead of studying is not actually a priority in line. The use of sarcasm is evident in the phrase "My priorities are in line," followed by the hashtag "#NOT."

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely acknowledges that they should be prioritizing studying over vacation planning. By using sarcasm, they recognize that their current actions are not aligned with what they believe are the correct priorities.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts suggest that they believe their actions are not properly aligned with their priority of studying.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm to humorously admit their misaligned priorities, suggesting they’re aware of their mistake and are not genuinely convinced that planning a vacation should be their priority over studying.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker is using sarcasm to highlight a misalignment of priorities between vacation planning and studying. They imply that planning a vacation is not genuinely a priority and acknowledge that they should prioritize studying. The hashtag "#NOT" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, as it contradicts the statement "My priorities are in line." The speaker is aware of their misprioritization and uses sarcasm humorously to reveal this.

The implicature is that the speaker knows vacation planning is not actually the appropriate priority. The presupposition is that prioritizing studying is important. The speaker's intent, likely directed toward an audience familiar with the struggles of balancing study and leisure, is to humorously highlight their misplaced priorities. The polarity of the statement is negative, as it admits to a failure of priorities. There is a pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they feign having aligned priorities through sarcasm.

The difference between the literal and implied meaning is significant. Literally, it suggests their priorities are in line, but impliedly, they admit the opposite. Given this analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic, as the speaker's true sentiment is opposite to the literal meaning. The preliminary analysis accurately captures the use of sarcasm and does not require changes.

"Taking a hour to shit is always a good thing. #not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that taking an hour to defecate is not a good thing, contrary to what they initially stated before the hashtag.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker clearly thinks that spending an hour in the bathroom for this activity is negative or undesirable.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they explicitly think convey the same sentiment – that taking an hour to defecate is not a positive experience.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The use of the hashtag "#not" indicates sarcasm, meaning the speaker's initial statement about it being a good thing is not genuine. Therefore, the speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude in the first part of the statement as a form of sarcasm, which is corrected by the hashtag.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement "Taking a hour to shit is always a good thing. #not" employs sarcasm. The implicature implied by the statement is that taking an hour to defecate is undesirable, contrary to the superficially positive claim. The presupposition is that readers understand the universally accepted idea that extended bathroom duration for this activity is not enjoyable. The speaker intends to express their dissatisfaction humorously, targeting an audience likely familiar with sarcasm or experiences of unexpectedly long bathroom sessions.

The polarity of the statement is negative, indicated by the hashtag "#not," which negates the positive tone of the initial sentence. There is pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they sarcastically suggest something they don't believe to be true. The literal meaning suggests that spending an extended period in the bathroom is beneficial, while the implied meaning highlights the inconvenience and undesirability of such a situation.

Upon reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it's clear that the speaker's statement is sarcastic, as they use subtle cues, such as #not, to subvert their initial, insincere claim. Therefore, the preliminary assessment correctly identified the sarcasm in the speaker's statement.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**Implicature**: The speaker implies that @masongoodman's presence is significant or exciting and that preparations should be made for an event, possibly suggesting @masongoodman is a popular or skilled DJ.

**Presuppositions**: It is assumed that @masongoodman is known to the audience and that his presence is noteworthy. Additionally, it is presumed that @AnnexBar hosts events where a DJ booth can be prepared, indicating a social or musical gathering.

**Intent of the speaker**: The speaker is likely aiming to express excitement and anticipation. By calling attention to @masongoodman's presence and urging the preparation of the DJ booth, they are engaging others in the enthusiasm for the upcoming event. The speaker appears to be a promoter, a fan, or simply an attendee excited about the event.

**Polarity**: The tone is positive, as indicated by the use of "Oh boy..." and the call to action to "Warm up the DJ booth," which underscores enthusiasm.

**Pretense**: There is no evident pretense in the speaker's attitude. The statement appears to be straightforward in its enthusiasm and excitement.

**Meaning**: The literal meaning of the statement is that @masongoodman is present and there should be preparation for DJ activities. The implied meaning embellishes the literal by suggesting a large scale of excitement and the significance of the event with @masongoodman.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, there doesn't seem to be a shift needed. The statement is more straightforward in its expression of excitement rather than layered in irony or sarcasm. Therefore, the statement is genuine and not sarcastic.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears to believe that Mark May's opinion is predictable or typical, indicating some level of skepticism or dismissal regarding his opinion.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement, "I'm shocked that Mark May doesn't think the Buckeyes should be in the playoff!!! #Sarcasm," is analyzed as follows:

- The presupposition is that Mark May is known for having opinions against the Buckeyes, which makes his current stance expected.
- The speaker's intent is to express disbelief in a humorous or mocking way, targeting an audience familiar with Mark May's usual opinions.
- The polarity is negative as it carries a dismissive or critical tone towards Mark May’s stance.
- The pretense exists as the speaker feigns surprise to emphasize how expected the situation truly is.

The speaker wrote, "Yay jury duty 😒 #sarcasm."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are not actually excited about being selected for jury duty, despite the use of the word “Yay,” which typically conveys enthusiasm or happiness.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely finds the prospect of jury duty to be unpleasant or inconvenient, as evidenced by the use of sarcasm and the displeased emoji.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, what the speaker implies and thinks are aligned. They are expressing disapproval or discontent about jury duty both through their sarcastic tone and the use of the emoji.

The speaker is pretending to have a positive attitude through the use of "Yay" but immediately reveals their true feelings with the sarcastic undertone and emoji, indicating they are not genuinely enthusiastic about the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement "Yay jury duty 😒 #sarcasm" implies that they are not actually excited about being selected for jury duty, despite the use of enthusiastic language. The presupposition here is the general understanding that people often find jury duty to be inconvenient or undesirable. The speaker hopes to convey their dissatisfaction or reluctance about jury duty to their audience. The tone of the statement is negative, evident from the displeased emoji and the use of the hashtag "#sarcasm" to highlight the sarcastic intent. There's pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they say "Yay" while actually feeling the opposite.

The literal meaning suggests excitement, but the implied meaning is dissatisfaction with jury duty. The preliminary analysis accurately captures the sarcasm in the statement, so no changes are needed. The statement is indeed sarcastic.

In the tweet, the speaker states: "@AfterGrogBlog #pantsdowntiggy was his crime. Pixelation #moot or #irony."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that "pantsdowntiggy" is a clear or apparent action, as they describe it as a "crime." They mention "pixelation," suggesting that something might have been obscured or censored, and they question whether this pixelation is "moot or irony." This implies that the pixelation is either unnecessary or ironically irrelevant because the essence of the action ("pantsdowntiggy") is obvious or known.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to think that the pixelation is either pointless or carries an ironic tone. They question the effectiveness or necessity of having pixelated whatever is involved with "pantsdowntiggy," possibly indicating skepticism about the act of pixelation itself.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thought suggest that the act of pixelating might not be accomplishing its intended purpose, possibly due to the obviousness of the situation or the inherent irony in attempting to hide it.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
It doesn't appear that the speaker is pretending to have an attitude; their use of terms such as "moot" and "irony" suggests a genuine questioning or critique about the handling of the situation with "pantsdowntiggy."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis of the tweet examines its implied meaning, tone, and the speaker's attitude. The tweet references "#pantsdowntiggy" as a "crime," suggesting a noteworthy or absurd act. Mentioning "pixelation" and questioning if it's "moot or irony" implies doubt about the necessity or purpose of censoring something that might already be widely known or obvious. The speaker's use of "moot" and "irony" signifies skepticism or critique of the pixelation's effectiveness, indicating that the speaker finds it either redundant or humorously ineffective.

In conclusion, the statement has a negative tone due to its critical perspective on the situation's handling. There is no apparent pretense in the speaker's attitude, as the language used suggests a straightforward critique rather than mock sincerity.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it captures the essential points well regarding the tweet's questioning nature and skepticism. However, it could further emphasize the irony in asking whether pixelation is moot when it might be serving the opposite of its intended purpose.

Based on these observations, the tweet is sarcastic. The irony or paradox in questioning pixelation when the action is presumably obvious demonstrates sarcasm.

"Tulisa has really made herself ugly #xfactor"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that Tulisa, presumably a public figure associated with X Factor, has undergone some change in her appearance which they find unfavorable.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker appears to have a negative opinion about the change in Tulisa's appearance, suggesting that they preferred her previous look or simply don't like how she looks now.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's direct thought express a negative sentiment about Tulisa's current appearance.

It doesn't seem that the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude; they straightforwardly express their disapproval or dislike about Tulisa's appearance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Tulisa has really made herself ugly #xfactor" implies that the speaker believes Tulisa, a public figure associated with X Factor, has changed her appearance in a way they find unattractive. The speaker has a negative opinion of this change, preferring her earlier appearance or simply disliking her current look. The literal and implied meanings align as both convey a negative sentiment about her appearance. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are direct in their expression of disapproval.

Upon reflection of the preliminary analysis, it seems complete and accurate. The alignment between the speaker's opinion, implication, and direct expression indicates sincerity rather than sarcasm. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic. Instead, it conveys a straightforward negative opinion about Tulisa's appearance.

"Don't you just love those people who won't shut up in class then hold everyone back by asking the teacher to repeat answers? #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are frustrated and annoyed by classmates who are disruptive and then further delay the class by needing information to be repeated.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker is clearly expressing their irritation and sarcasm about the behavior of these classmates. They seem to find their actions disruptive and counterproductive.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think align in conveying frustration and annoyance towards disruptive classmates who do not pay attention.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm to express their true feelings, so they are not pretending to have a different attitude. Instead, they are using irony to emphasize their genuine irritation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker is expressing frustration and annoyance towards classmates who continuously disrupt the class and then hold everyone back by asking the teacher to repeat information. The tone of the statement is sarcastic, and the use of sarcasm is deliberately emphasized by the inclusion of the hashtag "#sarcasm." The implicature is that the speaker does not actually "love" these actions but rather finds them exasperating. The presupposition is that being disruptive and inattentive in class is generally considered rude and inconsiderate, a view the speaker assumes the audience shares. The intent of the speaker is to vent their frustration with the situation and possibly to seek validation or agreement from others who might feel similarly. The polarity of the statement is negative, highlighting annoyance. There is an element of pretense in the sarcastic expression of "love" towards the annoying behavior, underscoring the difference between the literal expression of affection and the actual irritation the speaker feels.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it's clear that the statement's sarcasm is underscored by the direct mention of "#sarcasm," confirming the speaker's genuine feelings of frustration. The original analysis correctly identifies the sarcasm and irritation conveyed through the statement, so the conclusion that the statement is sarcastic needs no change.

The statement is: "Three minutes is better than no minutes."

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that having a limited or small amount of something is preferable to having none at all. It suggests a situation where time or another resource is limited, and any amount is deemed valuable or better than having nothing.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely views the situation as suboptimal but sees the value in having at least something rather than nothing. They seem to express a sense of pragmatism or acceptance in making the most of the limited minutes they have.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts align in recognizing the value of having something, even if it's only a small amount, over having nothing at all.

The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude. They seem to genuinely accept and find value in the small amount of time, suggesting an optimistic or realistic outlook on the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Three minutes is better than no minutes" is analyzed as follows:

- **Implicature**: The statement implies that a small amount of something is better than nothing at all, suggesting the situation has limitations and any gain is preferable. 
- **Presuppositions**: The speaker presupposes a context where time is scarce or limited. 
- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker likely wants to express an acceptance of the situation, finding value in a small gain within constraints.
- **Polarity**: The tone is positive as it recognizes the benefit in a minimal amount.
- **Pretense**: There seems to be no pretense; the speaker's attitude appears genuine.
- **Meaning**: The literal meaning aligns with the implied meaning, both highlighting the value of some time versus none.

Reflecting on this analysis, the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker genuinely accepts the value of having a little of something and expresses an optimistic stance rather than being ironic or mocking.

"My brother did this. Now I hate my brother even more. #jk #not #stilljk #fatbro http://t.co/ec8j6cy281"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that their brother did something that was somewhat bothersome or annoying to them, leading them to express disdain in a hyperbolic manner.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely views the situation with a mix of frustration and humor. The use of hashtags like #jk (just kidding), #not (not really/serious), and #stilljk (still kidding) suggest that while they are upset or annoyed, they are also not taking the situation too seriously.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  They are not entirely the same. While the speaker implies frustration or annoyance by saying, "Now I hate my brother even more," the tone of the statement, reinforced by the hashtags, indicates it's a lighthearted or joking sentiment rather than genuine hatred or resentment.

Finally, the speaker is likely pretending to have a more negative attitude towards the situation than they actually feel, using humor to express mild annoyance or frustration without genuinely holding those feelings towards their brother.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement implies annoyance or disdain towards their brother, yet this is expressed in a humorous and hyperbolic manner. The use of hashtags such as #jk (just kidding), #not, and #stilljk indicates that while there is an element of frustration, it is primarily conveyed in jest. Thus, the speaker does not seriously hate their brother but rather uses sarcasm to express mild irritation mixed with humor. The presupposition is that something trivial or amusing was done by the brother, and it leads to this playful exaggeration.

The polarity of the statement tilts towards a negative tone with "hate" being a strong word, but the presence of hashtags diminishes the seriousness. The pretense lies in the speaker exaggerating their feelings for comedic effect. The literal meaning suggests actual hatred, but the implied meaning tells us it's all in good humor and sarcasm.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker's use of hashtags and their verbal contrast highlight a pretense of negativity to humorously acknowledge a mildly irritating act by their brother.

The tweet states: "@fbhw great story about the student trying to get the teacher fired!!#sarcasm#moron#storywasstupid"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that the story about the student trying to get the teacher fired is not actually great; instead, they are using sarcasm to suggest that it is a bad or ridiculous story.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely thinks that the story is stupid and represents a moronic situation, as indicated by the hashtags #moron and #storywasstupid.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication (through sarcasm) and the explicit statement via hashtags indicate the speaker's negative view of the story.

The speaker is indeed pretending to have a positive attitude at the beginning of the statement by sarcastically calling it a "great story,” which they do not actually mean, as evidenced by the hashtags indicating their real thoughts.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker uses sarcasm by calling the story "great" to imply it was actually bad or ridiculous. The presupposition is that the audience knows the story is not genuinely great, as the speaker explicitly tags it with #sarcasm, #moron, and #storywasstupid. The intent is to criticize or mock the story, highlighted by the hashtags. The polarity of the statement is negative, and there is a clear pretense because the speaker feigns positivity initially, but doesn't mean it. The literal meaning contradicts the implied meaning, indicating sarcasm.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic because all elements—implicature, presuppositions, pretense, and hashtags—align to convey a mocking tone. No changes are necessary in the analysis.

The statement being analyzed is: "@ardhow @Jmroberts343Jmr @Squarehighways |Thats a twist|Algorithms to cause more congestion & increase pollution|Too bizarre to be true #not"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that there is a use of algorithms that may be causing more congestion and increasing pollution. They express skepticism about this claim, suggesting that it is a twist or unexpected.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to find the claim that algorithms are being used to increase congestion and pollution to be ironic or paradoxical. By using the phrase "Too bizarre to be true," followed by "#not," the speaker is likely suggesting that they actually find the situation believable, despite its apparent absurdity.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  The speaker's implication and their stated thoughts are somewhat aligned in expressing disbelief or irony about the idea, but the use of "#not" effectively flips the statement to indicate that despite the bizarre nature of the claim, the speaker actually believes it could be true.

The speaker appears to be using sarcasm or irony in their statement. The use of the hashtag "#not" suggests that they are pretending to express disbelief while actually acknowledging the possibility that the claim might be true. This indicates a certain attitude of skepticism mixed with a concession to the oddity of modern technological issues.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement uses sarcasm to address a claim about algorithms causing congestion and pollution. The speaker implies that this notion is absurd but subtly acknowledges it might be true by using "#not" after asserting skepticism. This hashtag flips the initially dismissive tone and suggests a belief that the situation, while bizarre, could be true. The speaker's intent is to highlight the irony of technology intended to streamline efficiency potentially exacerbating problems. The tone is negative, reflecting disapproval or criticism of this situation. The pretense lies in the speaker's initial feigned disbelief, which is contradicted by their real acknowledgment through sarcasm.

Upon reflecting on this analysis, we can conclude that the statement is indeed sarcastic. The literal meaning implies disbelief in the claim, but the true intent, revealed through sarcasm, is to highlight its plausibility in a critical way. Hence, the statement's sarcastic nature is effectively delivered through linguistic irony and rhetorical devices like the hashtag "#not."

The statement is: "Agree with that... #we #are #not #mind #readers #haha||#Repost 9gag ⁰You may think we are, but we are..."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that there is a common misconception or expectation from others that they can read minds or know what others are thinking. The hashtags and "haha" suggest they find this idea amusing or unrealistic.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to agree with the notion that people often assume others can intuitively understand their thoughts without explicit communication, but also finds the presumption humorous or absurd, as indicated by the laughter and lighthearted tone in "haha."

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the speaker is both implying and expressing directly that it is unrealistic to expect people to be mind readers, and they find this expectation amusing.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
It doesn't seem like the speaker is pretending; they appear to be genuinely amused by the unrealistic expectations some people have about mind-reading, as suggested by the informal and playful nature of their language. Their use of "haha" indicates a genuine attitude of finding humor in the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis of the statement suggests that the speaker implies there is a common misconception that people can read minds. The hashtags and "haha" indicate that the speaker finds this idea both amusing and unrealistic. The speaker agrees with the notion that people often assume others can understand their thoughts without clear communication but finds this thought humorous or absurd. Both the implication and the speaker's direct expression convey that it is unrealistic to expect people to be mind readers, and the speaker finds this entertaining. The speaker's tone, supported by the "haha," suggests a genuine amusement, and there is no apparent pretense in their attitude.

Upon reflection, the preliminary analysis correctly identifies the sarcasm in the statement. The use of "haha" and the playful tone implies that the speaker does not actually believe people think others can read minds, thus they find it amusing. Therefore, the statement is sarcastic as it humorously acknowledges an unrealistic expectation, poking fun at the assumption itself.

The statement is: "It's snowing in Chicago #whitechristmas #not"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that although snow is typically associated with a "white Christmas," this is not a positive or desired scenario for them. The use of "#not" suggests that the speaker might be using sarcasm or showing disappointment toward the snow.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker likely thinks that snow in Chicago at this time is undesirable or unfortunate. Their use of the hashtag "#not" indicates they don't view this snowfall as the idyllic or joyous "white Christmas" that is often romanticized.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, what the speaker implies and thinks are consistent. Both suggest a negative or sarcastic view of the snowfall, going against the typically positive connotations of a snowy Christmas scene.

The speaker is likely pretending to adopt a sarcastic or resigned attitude toward the snowfall, using hashtags to playfully or ironically convey their dissatisfaction with the situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement, "It's snowing in Chicago #whitechristmas #not," suggests an implied meaning, contrasting with the literal description and common association of snow with a "white Christmas." By appending "#not," the speaker implies the opposite of what a joyful "white Christmas" usually represents, indicating their dissatisfaction or annoyance with the snow. This indicates a presupposition that a snowy Christmas might generally be seen as positive, yet the speaker does not hold this view. The speaker's intent is to humorously or ironically share their disappointment about the weather situation with their audience, likely other social media users who understand or share their sentiment.

The polarity of the statement is negative due to the sarcastic tone indicated by "#not," contrasting the traditionally positive association with a white Christmas. Pretense is present in the speaker's attitude, as they pretend to acknowledge the typical charm of snow during Christmas but then subvert it with sarcasm. The meaning shifts from the literal acknowledgment of snow to the implied revealing of dissatisfaction or humorous irony about the situation.

Considering this analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The speaker uses sarcasm to express their true feelings about the snowfall, contrasting it with the supposed joy of a snowy Christmas.

The statement says, "@ProgressMich kids don't need schools! Schools just turn them into gay atheists, gaytheists, if you will. #sarcasm"

- The speaker implies that there is an exaggerated claim or a misunderstanding about what schools actually do, suggesting that some people might absurdly believe that schools indoctrinate children into a certain lifestyle or belief system like being "gay atheists."
- The speaker appears to be expressing skepticism or disagreement with this exaggerated belief. The use of the hashtag "#sarcasm" indicates that they are intentionally making an over-the-top statement to highlight its ridiculousness.
- Yes, what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are saying the same thing. The speaker is using sarcasm to emphasize their disagreement with the notion that schools have such a singular negative influence on children.
- The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude; instead, they are clearly using sarcasm to convey their true opinion about the idea that schools negatively influence children's sexual orientation or religious beliefs.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement from the Twitter user "@ProgressMich" is intended to be sarcastic. The speaker implies that there is a false and exaggerated belief that schools have a negative influence on children by turning them into "gay atheists," which they mock as "gaytheists." The presupposition here is that there are people who genuinely believe schools are negatively shaping children's identities, but the speaker believes this idea is absurd. The use of "#sarcasm" explicitly indicates the speaker's intent to mock this notion rather than support it. The polarity of the statement is negative towards the exaggerated belief rather than schools themselves or children's education. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude, as the sarcasm is clearly flagged. The literal meaning of the statement is negated by the sarcastic tone, which highlights the speaker's skepticism of the claim being mocked.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it correctly identifies the sarcasm and skepticism, so no changes are needed. The statement is definitely sarcastic, as the literal claim is intentionally over-the-top and not meant to be taken seriously.

The speaker recognizes this perspective as wise and insightful, indicated by their use of positive hashtags like "#words" and "#wisdom" and their explicit statement, "love this from @i2imovement." The speaker's intent is to share a message they agree with, promoting a particular view on forgiveness. There's no indication of pretense; rather, the language suggests genuine belief in the sentiment.

- The implicature suggests that the ultimate goal of forgiveness is self-benefit, in terms of internal peace, rather than judging the deservingness of others.
- The presupposition is that forgiveness is sometimes conditional on others deserving it, a notion this statement challenges.
- The intent is to convey, endorse, and spread awareness of a philosophy regarding forgiveness.
- The tone is positive, emphasizing peace and wisdom.
- There is no pretense; the speaker appears earnest in sharing this message.

The statement is: "@StephHammy @ZacapaRum lol.. Old enough to know better... Young enough to do it again"

- The speaker implies that they have the experience and maturity to understand the consequences of their actions ("Old enough to know better"), but still possess the youthful energy or inclination to repeat potentially risky or reckless behavior ("Young enough to do it again").
- The speaker thinks the situation is amusing or lighthearted, as indicated by the "lol" at the beginning of the tweet. They seem to embrace a playful or carefree attitude towards making mistakes or taking risks.
- What the speaker implies (the mix of maturity and youthful behavior) is consistent with what they seem to think (a carefree and humorous perspective on the situation).
- The speaker does not appear to be pretending to have a certain attitude. Their use of "lol" and the playful phrasing suggest genuine amusement and acceptance of their own behavior.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement expresses a mix of acknowledgment and defiance. The speaker implies that they are aware of the responsibilities that come with age ("Old enough to know better") but still feel compelled or willing to engage in actions considered to be youthful or risky ("Young enough to do it again"). The use of "lol" contributes to a lighthearted tone, suggesting the speaker finds humor in this contradiction of behavior. 

The implicature of the statement suggests self-awareness and an acceptance of their pattern of behavior. The presupposition is that experience has taught the speaker some caution, but not enough to deter them from repeating past actions. The speaker likely intends to amuse or entertain, possibly relating to both themselves and others who might feel similarly. They might also be addressing friends or peers – indicated by tagging @StephHammy and @ZacapaRum.

The polarity of the tone is amusing or positive, with an underlying acceptance of potential irresponsibility. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they communicate their thoughts honestly, without any deceit or insincerity.

In literal terms, the statement acknowledges the speaker's age and experience. However, its implied meaning is the speaker's willingness to embrace youthful tendencies despite knowing better.

Given the playful tone, genuine laughter with "lol," and acceptance of their behavior despite the contradiction, the statement leans more towards genuine humor rather than sarcasm. There is no critical edge or sharpness often associated with sarcasm. Therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.

The tweet states: "So there used to be a crossfit place here.... #irony #pizzawins http://t.co/9BDkxT9GFJ"

- The speaker implies that at the location where there used to be a CrossFit gym, there is now presumably a pizza place. This change is being characterized as ironic.
- The speaker thinks that it's amusing or noteworthy that a crossfit gym, which is associated with fitness and health, would be replaced by a pizza place, which is typically associated with indulgence and being less healthy.
- What the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks appear to be saying the same thing — the irony in replacing a fitness center with a place that sells pizza.

The speaker isn't pretending to have a certain attitude; they truly seem to find humor or irony in the situation, as indicated by the use of the hashtags #irony and #pizzawins.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Sarcasm would require a pretense or discrepancy between literal and intended meaning, which isn't present here. The speaker genuinely highlights irony rather than sarcasm.

"I just enjoy throwing up #not #hatethis #sick #wanna #go #to #school #for #once #take #me #away"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that they are currently sick and are experiencing vomiting. They sarcastically suggest enjoyment of this unpleasant experience to emphasize their frustration and discomfort.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker is clearly unhappy and frustrated about being sick and unable to attend school. They express a strong desire to be well and wish to return to their normal routine.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker’s actual thoughts indicate that they dislike being sick and are yearning for the ability to return to a normal routine, such as attending school.

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation; rather, they are expressing their true feelings about being sick in a sarcastic manner.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis identifies that the speaker is using sarcasm in the statement. By saying "I just enjoy throwing up," the speaker is implying the opposite of the literal meaning due to the inclusion of the hashtag "#not." The presupposition is that the speaker is currently sick and unable to go to school, which they dislike. The speaker's intent appears to be expressing frustration about their situation, likely with the hope of garnering sympathy or understanding from the audience. 

The polarity of the statement is negative, as it conveys discomfort and a desire to return to normalcy. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are genuinely expressing their negative feelings about being sick, albeit sarcastically. The difference between the literal and implied meaning is stark, as the speaker is not actually enjoying being sick.

The preliminary analysis accurately captures the sarcastic nature of the statement, and no significant changes are necessary. The statement is indeed sarcastic, reflecting the speaker's irritation and desire to get back to their routine.

The speaker's statement is: "Tax & NI on your wage slip is like Jim Bowen on bullseye goin 'look what you coulda won' #rubbingitin #crap"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that seeing the amount deducted for Tax and National Insurance on their wage slip is a disappointing experience, akin to being shown a prize you missed out on winning, as famously done by Jim Bowen on the TV show "Bullseye."

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker thinks that the deductions for Tax and National Insurance are frustrating and disappointing. They feel it's a letdown, similar to being teased with a prize that they could have won but didn't.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both what the speaker implies and thinks communicate a sense of frustration and disappointment about seeing Tax and NI deductions on their wage slip.

The speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation. Their use of the hashtag "#rubbingitin" suggests they genuinely feel irked and defeated by the deductions appearing on their wage slip.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Based on the statement and the preliminary analysis:

**Implicature**: The speaker implies that seeing taxes and National Insurance deductions on their wage slip feels disappointing, similar to being shown what they missed out on. 

**Presuppositions**: The audience understands the reference to Jim Bowen from "Bullseye," which involved showing contestants what they could have won after losing, and assumes familiarity with the frustration of wage deductions for taxes and NI.

**Intent**: The speaker aims to express frustration and relate to others who may share similar sentiments about tax deductions. The speaker likely intends to evoke a shared understanding or humor among those who feel similarly about their wages being reduced.

**Polarity**: Negative tone, conveyed by using expressions like "#rubbingitin" and "#crap," which denote dissatisfaction.

**Pretense**: There is no pretense. The speaker is straightforward about their displeasure with the situation, sincerely expressing their frustration.

**Meaning**: The literal meaning involves a comparison to a game show host's well-known phrase, while the implied meaning is about the disappointment felt with wage deductions. 

Reflecting on this preliminary analysis, the speaker's language, use of hashtags, and analogy to a game show suggest sarcasm. The speaker uses humor and exaggeration (by comparing tax deductions to lost game prizes) to criticize the tax system's impact on wages. Hence, the statement can be interpreted as sarcastic.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis indicates that the speaker perceives irony and potential inappropriateness in Michael Mann lecturing on professional ethics for climate scientists. The implicature suggests that the speaker finds it contradictory or absurd. The presupposition is that Mann's past actions or reputation do not align with the role of lecturing on ethics. 

The speaker's intent appears to be to criticize or mock the situation, effectively conveying disbelief or skepticism. The polarity of the statement is negative as it casts doubt on Mann's suitability for the role. There is no pretense; the speaker genuinely expresses irony and criticism.

The literal meaning of the statement is straightforward; Michael Mann is lecturing on ethics. The implied meaning, however, suggests that this is absurd or inappropriate due to Mann's perceived reputation or past actions.

The speaker states, "Video: #im#not#the#only#one#you#think#im#crazy# ahhhhhh http://t.co/uzznJHKepA" 

- The speaker implies that there is a shared experience or feeling among people; potentially their behavior or viewpoint isn't unique, and they aren't the only ones perceived as "crazy."
- The speaker may think that being labeled as "crazy" isn't entirely fair or accurate and seems to express some frustration or confusion about how they are perceived.
- Yes, both what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks seem to align. They both convey an expectation or belief that the perception of them as "crazy" is not entirely accurate but is a shared misunderstanding.
- It seems the speaker is not pretending to have a certain attitude but is perhaps genuinely expressing a mix of frustration and humor about the situation, as indicated by the use of "ahhhhhh" and the hashtags.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker seems to be addressing a perception that they and others share about being thought of as "crazy." The hashtags and video link suggest they are sharing content that supports or illustrates this shared perception. The use of "ahhhhhh" suggests some frustration or exasperation but could also imply humor. The speaker implies that this perception isn't entirely accurate, and they possibly feel misunderstood, but there is a collective experience around this notion. There is no pretense in the speaker's attitude; they seem to be genuinely expressing their feelings.

The statement has a negative tone, surfaced by the word "crazy," but this negativity is lightened by a humorous undertone. The literal meaning is that the speaker is sharing a video, while the implied meaning is that they want others to relate to or commiserate with their shared experience of being perceived as "crazy."

Upon reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it is inferred that the speaker's intent is to connect with the audience over a shared sentiment, rather than to seriously criticize the perception. Thus, the statement is intended to be light-hearted and somewhat humorous. Given these points, the statement is indeed sarcastic.

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
  The speaker implies that the current season in Milwaukee is unusually extended fall weather ("perma-fall"), rather than transitioning to winter as expected. The use of "#not" suggests sarcasm, indicating that the speaker finds this prolonged fall undesirable or frustrating.

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
  The speaker seems to be dissatisfied with the ongoing fall weather and is likely eager for winter or snow to arrive, as expressed by the hashtag "#gimmesnow." The speaker appears to prefer the colder winter weather over the unchanging fall conditions.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
  Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thoughts align in expressing discontent with the current weather conditions and a desire for a change to winter weather.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm and hashtags to convey their true feelings indirectly, possibly to add humor or emphasize their dissatisfaction in a lighthearted manner.

The hashtags "#not" and "#gimmesnow" reinforce this sentiment, suggesting a longing for winter or snowfall. The tone is negative, with an emphasis on frustration regarding the weather.

The literal meaning of describing the weather as "lovely" contrasts with the implied dissatisfaction, highlighting the sarcasm.

"Love waking up to no heat in my apartment #not #socold"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they are very displeased with the lack of heat in their apartment and are experiencing discomfort due to the cold.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely finds it frustrating and unpleasant to wake up in a cold apartment, and they're likely upset about the situation.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thought convey dissatisfaction and discomfort with the situation.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using sarcasm, as evident by the use of "#not," to emphasize their dissatisfaction. They are not pretending but rather using humor to convey their true feelings.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The preliminary analysis suggests that the speaker is sarcastic with their statement. The implicature here is that the speaker does not genuinely "love" waking up to no heat; rather, they are expressing dissatisfaction and discomfort. The presupposition is that having no heat leading to a cold apartment is typically unpleasant and undesirable, and the speaker implicitly understands this as common knowledge. The intent of the speaker is to express frustration humorously, likely to vent and share their annoyance about the cold with others. The tone of the last sentence is negative, indicated by the phrase "#not #socold," which contrasts with the literal positive phrasing of "Love waking up." There is pretense in the speaker's attitude as they claim to "love" the situation, which is contrary to their actual feelings. The difference between the literal and implied meanings is stark, as what is literally stated as "love" is meant to underscore their actual displeasure.

This analysis correctly identifies the statement as sarcastic. The speaker uses irony, saying the opposite of what they mean to highlight their discomfort and dissatisfaction with the lack of heat. No changes are necessary for the preliminary analysis, as it appropriately captures the sarcastic tone.

"Two years later & gingerbread house making still makes me cry."

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that making gingerbread houses is an emotionally significant activity for them, one that consistently evokes tears even after two years. This could imply either a sense of sentimentality or frustration associated with the activity.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to have a strong emotional response to gingerbread house making. It might be a cherished tradition that holds significant meaning, or it may be something they find overwhelmingly difficult, resulting in tears.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the speaker's thinking suggest a deeply emotional connection or reaction to making gingerbread houses.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker does not appear to be pretending. Their statement likely conveys a genuine emotional response to the activity, though the exact nature of the response (positive or negative) is not specified.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Two years later & gingerbread house making still makes me cry" suggests that the activity of making gingerbread houses consistently elicits tears from the speaker, even after two years. This could imply a sentimental or frustrating experience associated with the activity.

1. The Implicature - The speaker implies that gingerbread house making has an emotional impact that has not changed over time, suggesting a consistent emotional experience.
2. The Presuppositions - The speaker presupposes that the audience understands that gingerbread house making is typically not an activity that brings tears, hinting at an extraordinary reaction.
3. The intent of the speaker - The speaker, possibly reflecting to their followers, aims to share a personal and emotional aspect of their experience in a relatable manner.
4. The polarity - The tone of the statement is ambiguous; it could be positive (sentimental tears) or negative (tears from frustration).
5. Pretense - There seems to be no pretense in the speaker's attitude, as they convey a genuine emotional response.
6. Meaning - The literal meaning is that gingerbread house making makes the speaker cry, but the implied meaning is a deeper emotional connection to the activity, indicating either nostalgia or frustration.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, while it suggests a genuine emotional response, there's a glimpse of humor in using the word "cry" in a situation like gingerbread house making, which may indicate sarcasm. However, without clear negative cues or exaggeration, it seems more sincere. Therefore, the statement is likely not sarcastic.

The speaker implies that the Main Stream Media, Obama, Holder, DeBlasio, and others are responsible for the deaths of certain police officers. 

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that the mentioned individuals and institutions have directly or indirectly contributed to or caused harm to police officers, suggesting that their actions or rhetoric have led to violence against law enforcement. By saying they have "blood on their hands," it indicates a significant level of blame and responsibility being attributed to them.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker appears to think that these figures have played a negative and possibly malicious role in the events that led to the harmful situation for police officers. There seems to be a belief that the rhetoric or policies from these individuals or groups have incited violence or contributed to hostile attitudes toward the police.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the implication and the thought process align. Both suggest that the speaker believes there is direct culpability on the part of the individuals or groups mentioned for the violence against police officers.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Here's a summary of the preliminary analysis:

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies that Main Stream Media, Obama, Holder, DeBlasio, and others are responsible for the deaths of police officers, suggesting their actions or rhetoric have led to violence against law enforcement.
- **Presuppositions**: It is taken for granted that these individuals and institutions have directly or indirectly incited harm to police officers.
- **Intent**: The speaker aims to hold the mentioned figures accountable for violence against the police, likely addressing an audience that shares or might be swayed by this view.

- **Polarity**: The tone is negative, attributing grave blame and responsibility.
- **Pretense**: There appears to be no pretense; the speaker genuinely holds the individuals accountable.
- **Meaning**: The literal statement places blame for the deaths of police officers on the individuals and institutions mentioned; the implied meaning is an accusation of their rhetoric or policies causing these deaths.

Based on this analysis, the statement is not sarcastic. The speaker is expressing a genuine belief and serious accusation rather than using irony or sarcasm to highlight an opposing view. The preliminary analysis accurately captures the intent and tone of the statement, and no changes are needed before concluding that the statement is not sarcastic.

The statement is: "Well maybe if you werent such a noob you would be up talking to me at 2:30 in the morning :P"

- The speaker is implying that the person they're addressing, HallieCiera, is not at their level or lacks the stamina or interest to stay up late talking at 2:30 in the morning.
- The speaker seems to tease or gently mock HallieCiera, indicating a playful, if slightly condescending, tone. They may believe that being able to stay up late is a sign of experience or dedication, or perhaps the speaker is simply trying to provoke a reaction.
- Both the speaker's implication and their thoughts convey a playful judgment toward HallieCiera's supposed inability or unwillingness to stay up talking late. There's consistency between what they imply and what they think.
- The speaker is likely not pretending. The use of "noob," a term often used in gaming or online communities to refer to someone inexperienced, and the playful emoticon ":P" suggest the speaker is lightheartedly teasing rather than seriously criticizing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement by @HallieCiera humorously implies that staying up late is a mark of experience or dedication, calling the addressed person a "noob" for possibly not doing so. The use of "noob" is a playful mock from the speaker, generally teasing them for lacking stamina or interest in late-night conversations. An emoticon ":P" further amplifies the playful tone, indicating that the speaker is not genuinely critical but rather engaging in light-hearted teasing. There's no pretense, as the speaker's tone remains consistent throughout, aiming to provoke a friendly reaction.

In analyzing sarcasm:
- **Implicature:** The speaker implies that chatting late into the night is notable or desirable, mockingly suggesting HallieCiera falls short of this.
- **Presuppositions:** It's taken for granted that staying up late is an activity worthy of being part of, possibly in certain social or gaming circles.
- **Intent:** The speaker hopes to humorously challenge or tease HallieCiera, potentially pushing them to engage in a late conversation.
- **Polarity:** The tone, enhanced by ":P", remains playful and lighthearted rather than truly negative.
- **Pretense:** There's no pretense; the intent to engage playful teasing is honest.
- **Meaning:** While literally pointing out HallieCiera’s inability to stay up, the implied meaning is simply teasing, without serious critique.

With these inferences, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The light use of sarcasm comes through in the teasing manner and choice of words, contrasting the literal implication of inadequacy with a context of friendship and humor. The analysis is accurate overall and does not require changes.

The statement made is: "Pulled by White Van Man by the looks of it. Yuk .. so naff. That keeps the magic of Xmas alive..#NOT"

- The speaker implies that whatever situation they are referencing does not meet their expectations of festive or magical standards, which they sarcastically suggest should keep the "magic of Xmas alive."
- The speaker thinks the situation is underwhelming, tacky, or disappointing, as indicated by their use of "Yuk" and "so naff," which convey disdain or disapproval.
- What the speaker implies and what they think are consistent; both reflect dissatisfaction and a lack of respect or appreciation for the situation depicted. 

The speaker is adopting a sarcastic tone, which suggests they are not genuinely expressing the sentiment that this situation keeps the Christmas magic alive. Instead, they are likely voicing their belief that the situation detracts from the festive spirit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement made by the speaker suggests that they are unimpressed by a scenario described as being "pulled by White Van Man." The phrase "Yuk .. so naff" indicates disdain and disapproval, suggesting that the speaker finds the situation tacky or disappointing. The use of the hashtag "#NOT" emphasizes the sarcastic nature of the final sentence, where the speaker claims it "keeps the magic of Xmas alive," implying the opposite of what is literally stated.

- **Implicature**: The speaker implies that the situation is far from magical and detracts from the spirit of Christmas.
- **Presuppositions**: The speaker assumes the audience understands that "White Van Man" and the described situation are not typically associated with Christmas magic.
- **Intent of the Speaker**: The speaker aims to convey their disappointment and sarcastically criticize the situation for lacking festive charm. The speakers seem to be Andy Green and Barry Island, possibly discussing a shared observation.
- **Polarity**: The overall tone of the statement is negative, as indicated by words like "Yuk" and "naff."
- **Pretense**: There is pretense in the speaker's attitude; they are not literally expressing that the situation preserves Christmas magic.
- **Meaning**: The literal meaning suggests something magical or festive, while the implied meaning is the exact opposite.

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic. The sarcasm lies in the mismatch between the expected festive sentiment and the described disappointing scenario.

The tweet states: "I guess waking up every couple hours is cool |#not"

- What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?

- What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker likely finds waking up every couple of hours to be frustrating or unpleasant. They are expressing dissatisfaction with the situation.

- Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both the implication and the thought behind the statement are in agreement. The speaker implies through sarcasm that waking up frequently is not cool, and they also think it is an undesirable situation.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The tweet from the speaker is: "I guess waking up every couple hours is cool |#not"

**Preliminary Analysis Summary:**

1. **The Implicature:** The speaker implies that waking up every couple of hours is not actually cool or enjoyable, despite initially stating otherwise. The use of sarcasm is evident, especially with the hashtag "#not" which negates the preceding statement.

2. **Presuppositions:** It is taken for granted that the audience understands this is a sarcastic statement, a common communication form on platforms like Twitter. The hashtag further helps communicate this presupposition.

3. **The Intent:** The speaker likely aims to express their dissatisfaction or frustration about their sleeping pattern. By using sarcasm, they hope to share or vent their displeasure, potentially seeking commiseration or acknowledgement from others who may relate.

4. **Polarity:** The tone of the sentence is negative. Even though it initially presents a facade of positivity, it quickly transitions to negativity with the #not.

5. **Pretense:** There is pretense as the speaker feigns a positive attitude towards the situation that they are actually displeased with.

6. **Meaning:** The literal meaning of the statement is that waking up every couple of hours is cool. However, the implied meaning, driven by sarcasm and the hashtag, is that the speaker finds it uncool and bothersome.

**Reflection:**

The preliminary analysis accurately identifies the statement as sarcastic. The literal message is not the actual sentiment of the speaker, as indicated by the hashtag and the negative implication. Thus, the statement is indeed sarcastic. No significant changes are needed in the analysis, as it captures the core elements of sarcasm within the tweet effectively.

The tweet states: "if it got the attention of the smartass to comment that.. Didnt it work anyway?? #irony"

- The speaker implies that the situation they are referring to was successful because it elicited a reaction or comment from someone who they consider a "smartass."
- The speaker seems to think that the situation, despite potentially being criticized or mocked, achieved some level of success or attention, which they might view as the ultimate goal or validation.
- What the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks are similar in this case. They imply that gaining attention was an essential outcome, and they think that the act of attracting a reaction proves its success.
- The speaker might be pretending to have a more nonchalant or ironic attitude about receiving a comment from a "smartass," suggesting they didn't care about the nature of the attention, only that attention was gained. The use of the hashtag "#irony" further supports this interpretation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker is implying that a situation was successful because it gained the attention of a "smartass," suggesting that the reaction is a form of validation. They are presupposing that gaining attention, regardless of its nature, is inherently successful. The speaker's intent seems to be to highlight this irony and possibly to mock or dismiss the nature of the attention received. The tone of the last sentence is somewhat negative, as it mocks the perceived "smartass" and highlights the irony of their comment.

The preliminary analysis suggests that there is an element of pretense, as the speaker's attitude feigns indifference to the nature of the attention. The literal meaning is that a comment was made by someone regarded as a "smartass," but the implied meaning is that such attention, even if negative, proves the success of the original situation.

Upon reflecting on the analysis, it appears that the statement is sarcastic. The hashtag "#irony" is a clue that the speaker is deliberately using irony to underscore the contradiction between the perceived success and the negative attention received. The sarcasm lies in the implied dismissal of the "smartass" comment while reveling in the attention it brings.

"Its a shame on an off day that the NFL doesnt have any interesting stories and isnt getting any attention. NOT #sarcasm"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that contrary to their statement, the NFL is indeed getting attention and has interesting stories even on an off day. The use of "NOT" and "#sarcasm" indicates that they are being sarcastic about it being a "shame" that the NFL isn't interesting.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker thinks that the NFL is currently attracting attention and has engaging stories, even on days when there are no games. They believe that there's considerable buzz around the NFL despite it being an off day.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, the use of sarcasm aligns what the speaker is implying with what they actually think. They are rhetorically stating the opposite of what they truly believe to highlight how interesting and attention-worthy the NFL really is.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is deliberately using sarcasm to convey their real attitude, which is opposite to what is literally said. They are not genuinely concerned about the NFL lacking attention; instead, they are emphasizing its current popularity.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The speaker's statement suggests that it's remarkable how the NFL is booming with stories and maintaining attention even on days without games. The sentence's literal meaning claims a lack of interest, but the "NOT" and "#sarcasm" elements directly contradict that, indicating sarcasm. The implicature is that the NFL is, in fact, buzzing with activity and capturing public interest. The presupposition here is the understanding that the NFL is typically active and engaging, even on off days. The speaker's intent is likely to humorously emphasize the NFL’s ongoing relevance. 

The polarity of the sentence, considering its sarcastic nature, ultimately leans positive since it highlights the league's continual interest. There is a clear pretense in the speaker's attitude as the statement is phrased opposite to what they genuinely mean. 

Reflecting on the preliminary analysis, it accurately identifies the sarcasm in the statement. The analysis correctly interprets what the speaker is implying and what they truly think, both emphasizing the ongoing engagement with the NFL. Hence, the statement is sarcastic.

"Rolled out of bed for closing.... #ilookreallygood #not"

-What does the speaker imply about the situation with their statement?
The speaker implies that they did not take much time to get ready before attending a closing, perhaps a significant meeting or event. They also imply, through the sarcastic hashtag "#ilookreallygood #not," that they do not believe they actually look good.

-What does the speaker think about the situation?
The speaker seems to think that they are not looking their best because they had to get up quickly or at the last minute for an important event. They are using humor or sarcasm to express this self-deprecating observation about their appearance.

-Are what the speaker implies and what the speaker thinks saying the same thing?
Yes, both what the speaker implies and what they think are aligned. The sarcasm in the hashtag indicates the speaker is aware they do not appear polished or presentable for this important task, and they are communicating this humorously.

Finally, decide if the speaker is pretending to have a certain attitude toward the conversation.
The speaker is using humor and sarcasm, which suggests they are not taking the situation too seriously. However, they are not pretending about their appearance – rather, they are earnestly highlighting their last-minute and possibly unprepared state, albeit in a light-hearted manner.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The statement "Rolled out of bed for closing.... #ilookreallygood #not" suggests a humorous take on the speaker's unprepared and likely disheveled appearance for a significant event, possibly a meeting or business closing. The implicature indicates that while the speaker literally mentions rolling out of bed, they are actually highlighting their lack of preparedness. The presupposition is that attending a closing usually requires one to look presentable, which the speaker implies they do not. The intent of the speaker is likely to make a self-deprecating joke, engaging their audience with humor by being candid about their appearance.

Analyzing the tone, the hashtag "#ilookreallygood #not" carries a negative tone, playfully commenting on their appearance. There is pretense in the sense that the speaker pretends to compliment themselves only to immediately contradict it, creating a contrast between the literal praise and the implied self-criticism. The contrast between literal and implied meaning makes the statement sarcastic. The speaker's sarcasm is intended to amuse themselves and their audience by highlighting the discrepancy between societal expectations and personal reality.

Given the analysis, the statement is indeed sarcastic, as humor and irony are used to emphasize the speaker's actual, unstated belief about their appearance. The preliminary analysis accurately captures the use of sarcasm and need not change.
